<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>At the ACCU Conference back in April Russel
gave one of the keynotes on the future of computer architectures in the face of
the stagnation that has occurred with single processor speeds. The <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">London</st1:place></st1:City> branch of the ACCU
welcomed him to one of the Skills Matter offices to talk further on the subject
in November. There was an excellent turnout of around twenty-something people
so latecomers such as myself had to stand at the back. There were once again a
number of new faces – some of whom I later grilled in The Slaughtered Lamb only
to discover that they had already become members.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The premise of Russel’s talk was similar to
that of his keynote, but whereas previously the bias seemed to be towards
hardware, there was a larger software and programming language element to this
presentation which made the trip equally worthwhile for us conference
attendees. By the time I arrived Russel was in full swing describing the
multi-core revolution and how threads are merely a distraction on the way to
the true goal of independent computation units that consist of a straight
pairing of CPU and memory. This was well and truly rammed home by the continual
reuse of one presentation slide that showed two columns of CPU/RAM pairs connected
by an “interconnect”. It has been apparent for some time that the chasm between
CPU and memory performance is widening rapidly and multi-core CPUs will only
fan the flames. Russel contends that although the likes of Intel have a 48 core
chip in the wings the memory contention this introduces means that its possible
that 16 cores could well be the ceiling (in compute bound scenarios).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>On the software side the picture painted
was even less rosy as Russel pointed out that none of the major programming
languages (i.e. Java, C++, Ruby, Python etc) have any natural support for the
programming models of the future. Yes there are libraries designed to make the
task less painful but you still have to get your feet wet to some degree. I’ve
never quite been sure what the actual distinctions are between the Actor, CSP
and DataFlow models and so I was pleased that Russel spent the time spelling
this out. Of course the code we write in our high-level languages still needs
to execute within some runtime environment that itself is likely hosted by an
Operating System. And the picture looks no better here either as the key
players are all monolithic architectures with an inherent limit that assumes
all memory is globally addressable. One answer it seems may be in the form of
Hypervisors and micro-kernels where each computation unit runs its own
(possibly different) OS. Naturally Russel was quick to point out that none of
this is new, it’s just that most of us have managed to avoid it until now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>What made this presentation an improvement
on the keynote was the acknowledgement of how all this affects those outside
the world of Super Computing. Yes it all makes sense for the big number
crunchers like meteorology and quantum physics, but how does this affect the man
on the street who’s PC spends the majority of its time waiting for user input?
It probably won’t, at least for a traditional PC set up, but a move to a Thin
Client model might provide the kind of catalyst whereby small chunks of
processing would need to be farmed out, e.g. spell checking paragraphs in
parallel. Interesting times lie ahead that’s for sure.</span></p>
