<p class=MsoTitle>Afterwood</p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>After more than two decades as a programmer you would think
I’d have got this whole screening and interviewing process licked, but just
when I think I’ve found the optimal solution I once again find another “edge
case” that blows my theory out of the water. The problem of course with hiring
people is that it involves human beings and humans are notoriously difficult to
deal with because, well, they’re all different.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In my early years as a professional programmer I suffered
from an arrogance which suggested that all the decent programmers in the world probably
had backgrounds in engineering rather than computer science. Having studied
electronic systems engineering at university myself (though sucking badly at
everything apart from the assembly programming side due to my bedroom coder
upbringing) I entered professional programming with a good appreciation for the
hardware which was useful in the industry where I started out – PC graphics applications.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Correlation of course does not imply causation and with such
a small data set to work from it’s not surprising I came to such a conclusion
(I suck at statistics too it seems). I subconsciously fostered this view for some
years which naturally biased my opinion of people whose CVs crossed my path. I
don’t remember discarding anyone solely based on that criterion but I’m sure
any candidate who reached the interview stage will unknowingly have had yet
another prejudice to overcome. Eventually I got to work in a big team at a
large company and mixed with all kinds of people from different backgrounds
which helped dissipate that particular notion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However there is just not enough time to interview every
candidate face-to-face that crosses your path and so you have to develop
multiple heuristics if you are ever to separate the proverbial “wheat from the
chaff”. Every time I think I’ve come up with a fairly solid heuristic I
invariably end up working with special people that buck the trend and I once
again begin to feel discomfort in how many others of a similar calibre I may have
discarded because not enough of what I felt were the right boxes, were ticked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For example when hiring for senior roles, which is what I’ve
mostly been involved in, I would historically hope for them to show some kind
of interest in programming outside of their 9 to 5 job, especially when they
describe themselves as “passionate” about the career. This does not have to be anything
as grandiose as leading a major open source project or writing a column, but
just something simple like regularly attending a meetup, or reading a journal
or blog. It turns out some people are really good at keeping a sensible work/life
balance. This doesn’t mean they don’t help out when things go awry but that
they don’t unnecessarily subscribe to a hero mentality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another heuristic I’ve tried on pre-screening phone calls is
to get the candidate to talk about their programming “war stories”. Any meetups
or conferences I’ve attended that results in a trip to the pub usually ends up
with various people describing some of the bizarre code or production incidents
they’ve had to deal with in their past. There is almost a case of one-upmanship
going on as the night progresses and alcohol is consumed. However unless they
are of our own making and we feel entirely comfortable sharing our mishaps
these stories usually come at the expense of someone else and therefore we may
be behaving no better than the archetypal builder who denigrates the work of
others. Being asked to do that with a prospective employer naturally makes some
people uncomfortable. Another idea scrapped. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It’s now been a decade since the classic Fizz Buzz
programming exercise entered the mainstream consciousness and yet I’m still
amazed at the number of overly complex solutions I’ve had to review from
experienced developers. Paradoxically I’ve also rejected candidates based on
this simple programming problem only to discover they’ve been hired because of
other forces at play. I consider this a lucky escape and rejoice that a sane
hiring process has won out, but once again I feel uncomfortable with the
outcome of a screening process designed solely to weed out highly undesirable
candidates. I’ve found myself questioning over and over again what signs I’d
missed this time around. If the purpose is to hire someone that can write simple
code, what does it say when asking them to do just that with a simple problem in
their own time ends up going awry? It seems some people really struggle to
believe you when you say you want a simple solution to a simple problem; they
want to impress you, to show you what they can <i>really</i> do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My early experiences in the interviewing process (as hirer,
not seeker) were definitely predicated on a desire to find someone like myself.
I don’t believe this was in a narcissistic kind of way, but more borne out of
the need to find someone suitable using the minimal time out from normal duties.
Is it any wonder all the heuristics I came up with were really just how I see
myself? And then there is the need to feel that we must choose the <i>best</i>
candidate from those we have shortlisted as if we were out shopping for a new
car and wanted to be sure we had gotten the best deal possible. Too many times
a good candidate has gotten away because we hoped that someone later would be
even better. Hiring, just like programming it seems, is also subject to the
problems of “gold plating”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, when the next recruitment agent or HR person asks the
inevitable question “what should I be looking out for to identify the best
candidates for you?” the best I can do is shrug my shoulders. Yes, I can
provide some useful heuristics that may help me prioritise candidates through
the initial screening process but ultimately it seems I still have to fall back
on the most subjective heuristic of all – gut instinct.</p>
