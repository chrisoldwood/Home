<p class=MsoTitle>Afterwood</p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>After finishing my first article for C Vu just over a decade
ago I was asked to come up with a short biography and photo to give ACCU readers
a tiny insight into the author. At that point the only thing I’d ever written
to describe myself was a CV for job applications but I’d guessed that wasn’t
really what they were looking for. Instead I had to find a way to sum myself up
in just a sentence or two.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I’m a firm believer that “context is king” and therefore I
decided that to distil my essence into such a short piece I should focus on
where I came from (programmatically speaking) and where I am now so the reader could
extrapolate from that the kinds of projects and organisations that have shaped
my programming career, and consequently my writing. Hence I arrived at the bio
you now see adorning my articles to this very day (recent pandemic related
tweak notwithstanding).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>During my university years and the start of my professional
programming career I saw being an “80’s bedroom coder” as a badge of honour.
Working at a small software house writing graphics software to run on
underpowered PCs required some of the skills I had developed writing demos in
assembly during my teens, such as the ability to read what the optimizing
compiler had come up with and then find a way to make it work when the compiler
got it badly wrong. Who knew that in the real world though most code is not
written in assembly with speed being the only concern...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My new found interest in networking and distributed systems
caused me to leave that behind and enter the corporate world in a freelance
capacity. Time marched on, CPUs grew faster and ever more complex, optimizing
compilers become reliable, disk and network speeds jostled for position, memory
became abundant, and the claims on my CV about my knowledge of PC hardware
become weaker as I slowly moved “further up the stack”. What I once (naively) saw
as the meat-and-potatoes of programming had been downgraded to “mechanical
sympathy” [1].</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For me any appreciation of new hardware or technology has
tended to come from a single impressive moment of its application rather than a
change in numbers on a data-sheet. For instance I had a low opinion of the JVM
in the early 2000’s until I saw some Atari ST demos that Equinox (an old Atari demo
group) had ported to run as Java applets and, while it was sluggish on the Sun
JVM, they ran real-time on the Microsoft JVM. Any performance reservations of the
mundane Java project I was assigned to at the time dropped away instantly.
Sadly they were replaced by a more unexpected time bomb – the buggy date/time
class.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My jaw dropped again some years later when I got to see the
Linux kernel boot-up inside a web browser without using native code. Likewise a
DHTML version of Lemmings and the Unreal engine helped remove any other
preconceptions I might have had around what can be achieved with a browser and
a modern JavaScript engine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One networking epiphany came when I had to debug an
occasional crash in a C++ based service and I struggled for some time to believe
what my eventual hypothesis was suggesting – that the service could send a
financial trade to another machine, value it, and return and process the
response on another thread before the sending thread got switched back in. As
for disk I/O, which has never really been that stellar under Windows, I sported
a rather large grin the first time I experienced compiling C++ code on an SSD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>More recently-ish I attended Jason McGuiness’s ACCU talk
about the impact of Meltdown and Spectre on high-frequency trading. Any
pretence I might still have had that my mental model of what went on inside a
modern CPU was readily dismissed; in my heart I probably knew that but it was
still a brutal awakening after all those teenage years counting cycles.
Although I still occasionally inspect modern assembly code in the debugger it’s
really the stack traces I’ve become more interested in as I try to reason about
the flow rather than question the compiler’s choice of instructions and
sequencing to get the best out of a CPU.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, as I write these very words, there is a flurry of
excitement about Apple’s new M1 chip and how its ability to emulate a different
CPU architecture faster than the real thing is an impressive achievement. For
those “in the know” I’m sure it’s just one more inevitable step forward, but
for me it’s yet another virtualization bubble burst. Even Knuth’s MIX is struggling
to stay relevant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And that’s one of the downsides with being a programmer as
the years whizz past, there comes a point at which you find yourself spending
more and more time “unlearning”. You might say it’s really just learning
something new but unlearning is really about trying to forget what you learned
because the game has changed and you need to catch back up with those that
never learned the old ways in the first place. Unchecked, that badge of honour
is slowly turning into a millstone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Modern C++ is yet another example. I used to have a snippet
of code I liked to chew over with candidates in an interview that encapsulated
various idioms and pitfalls when working in C++. It was a well-honed example
based on 15 years of blood sweat and tears and yet most of the discussion
points are now moot as the language has changed dramatically since then due to
move semantics, lambdas, range-based for loops, etc. Old habits die hard and unlearning
that you shouldn’t return containers by value because it now Just Works™ is another
example where years of inertia can be difficult to overcome.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Luckily there are still some inalienable truths to keep me
warm at night, like the speed of light limiting my ping time and giving me an
excuse for why I lost at Fortnite, yet again. Having sympathy for the machine
is undeniably a valuable skill but who has sympathy for the poor programmer that
is forever learning and then unlearning to keep up with the march of progress
in an effort to stay relevant in today’s fast paced world?</p>

<h3>Biography</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chris is a freelance programmer who started out as a bedroom
coder in the 80’s writing assembler on 8-bit micros. These days it's enterprise
grade technology <s>in plush corporate offices</s> from the lounge below his
bedroom. With no Godmanchester duck race to commentate on this year he’s been
even more easily distracted by messages to gort@cix.co.uk and @chrisoldwood.</p>
