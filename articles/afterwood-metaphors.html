</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second most popular joke in programming reminds us that
naming is hard. (In a Programming Jokes Top 10, this would be the other one.) That
hasn’t stopped some people apparently attempting to overcome this problem by applying
a “formula” which generally involves concatenating various Computer Science and
business terms together and finally appending one of Manager, Service, or Provider
to give it extra gravitas. The problem appears to be particularly acute in the enterprise
world of Java and C# where Design Pattern Bingo is a popular pastime.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What triggered this latest Afterwood was working in a C# codebase
where there had been a need to write tests for code that invoked <span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>DateTime.Now()</span> which is a static
method that returns the current date and time. Doing a spot of software archaeology,
I noticed there had been an initial attempt to work around the non-deterministic
nature of this method by doing an assertion in the tests with a small tolerance,
but the woefully underpowered CI server put paid to that as the tolerance was widened
every time the tests took longer than usual to run.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The solution had been to mock out the method call entirely and
return a fixed value in the tests and the real date &amp; time in production by
introducing a suitable interface and pair of concrete implementations. Naturally,
if you’re looking to name an interface for such an abstraction you’re probably thinking
“what do I call an interface that provides a date &amp; time value?” and so you
go with the first thing that pops into your head – <span style='font-family:
"Courier New"'>IDateTimeProvider</span>. Wait, that’s not right…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I don’t know for sure how this name really came about but
the seemingly robotic approach to so many names in the codebase suggested they
were driven by terms from the <i>solution</i> domain instead of the problem domain
or, say, The Real World™. I posited on the team chat that the <span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>IDateTimeProvider</span> abstraction was basically
just a “clock”, and that was largely met with approval, so the refactoring went
straight in. It also opened the door for a further discussion about naming, metaphors,
and typing less. (Strunk famously tells us to “omit needless words” which has
the marginal added benefit of less wear and tear on the keyboard.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The world of software is entirely virtual in nature and
therefore we must rely very heavily on metaphors as a source of inspiration for
how we name stuff. The great thing about the world of horology is that it provides
us with a whole host of physical devices to draw from. “Clocks” and “calendars”
allow us to discover the current time and date, “stopwatches” allow us to measure
time, and “timers” can be used to notify us when a period has elapsed. Clocks
come in many different shapes and sizes, and degrees of precision, so if you
want to capture that in your naming scheme you could use “wall clock” for the low-end
and a highfalutin name like “chronometer” for the high-end.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While the name <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>IDateTimeProvider</span>
might on the surface appear to be sufficient for the task, I argued that it’s <i>too</i>
abstract. This also gave the perfect opportunity to play one of my Programming Quote
Top Trump cards [1] from Edsger Dijkstra:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Being abstract is something profoundly different from
being vague … The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a
new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The point of using a metaphor is to allow us to be <i>more</i>
precise about the kind of thing we're talking about by borrowing from a
recognisable domain. When talking to the business we would expect to use a “ubiquitous
language” and expect the problem domain to provide many of the terms we use in
our code. When it comes to the technical domain, something which the business will
have almost no input on, we are left to our own devices. This does not absolve us
of the responsibility to be clear about what we mean in the code. If anything, we
have to work harder because it’s not handed to us on a plate. (Pro Tip: always keep
a thesaurus on hand for inspiration [2].) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One comment to my suggested renaming was that it didn’t really
matter because although the code said “<span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>IDateTimeProvider</span>”,
in their head they mentally translated that into “clock” anyway. This misses
one of the key points about why we refactor code – to ensure that it always reflects
the best understanding we have of the domain at any given point in time. If your
best mental model is currently a clock, then that’s what it should be called (for
now), don’t make people waste brain cycles second-guessing what might have been
meant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And it is just a model, and an imperfect one at that. Playing
my second Quote Top Trump card – George Box – we are reminded that “all models
are wrong, some are useful”. In some scenarios it could be a poor metaphor because
a clock may conjure up a different kind of device, such as in electronics where
the clock is an oscillating signal, more like a metronome ticking left and
right, than a pair of hands slowly turning around a circle. Fortunately, the
same stable that brought us the notion of a ubiquitous language also helps us
resolve our conflict here by applying a “bounded context” around our codebase
so that the interpretation is the most fitting one for our part of the business
instead of encompassing every potential definition covered by Wikipedia.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hopefully the use of the clock metaphor will be timeless,
but as we get older we do need to be aware of anachronisms, such as the nautical
terms I wrote about back in June [1]. Once upon a time Hi-Fi Separates (where
the turntable, tape deck, CD player, amp, etc. were all distinct devices
connected by standard RCA cables) was a common metaphor for a component-based
architecture but that seems to have died out as headphones (except on public
transport) is the only accessory for the “modern Hi-Fi”, aka the phone. And if
you’re still thinking of using a floppy disk for your save icon then I’m afraid
that ship sailed a long time ago!</p>
