<div class=Section1>

<h1 align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>Developer Freedom</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='text-align:right'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span lang=EN-GB>“All employees are equal, but some employees are more
equal than others”<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='text-align:right'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span lang=EN-GB>– George Orwell (mostly)</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>When it comes to the subject of access to
the Internet developers are quite clearly far more equal than any other sort of
employee in the business. Or at least some think so, but are we?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Over the last decade I’ve found myself
working at some big corporations – the kind of places where IT is a part of the
business, but not the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>actual</i> business
itself (despite what you might choose to believe about its importance today). As
a consequence there is almost a Mexican standoff between the security team,
whose purpose is to keep the company safe, and the developers/testers/support
staff whose job is to provide and maintain solutions to solve business
problems. To perform this function effectively <span class=GramE>invariably</span>
requires accessing some content and/or downloading additional tools that the
company does not already provide for. So what’s the big deal?</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The landscape has changed dramatically over
the last 20 years where malicious content has evolved from being the result of
misguided individuals with something to prove, to being a business – if you
consider organised crime a business that is. At least, that’s if you believe
what the security industry tells us. Throw in the recent revelations about government
spying and I don’t think it’s hard to see why the paranoia levels in the
security departments of these big corporations are at Spinal Tap [1] levels.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Take my own personal web site as an example
of where the level of corporate trust is almost certainly very low. I have
always made the source code available alongside every tool I’ve ever published
as a courtesy to anyone who might be interested. But let’s face it how many
developers download the source code, sift through it to make sure there aren’t
any exploits, then build it and finally see if it’s going to be useful?
Virtually none, I’d wager. In fact I’d question whether the license agreement
even gets an airing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>No, what we do is see if the web site <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>looks</i> legitimate, i.e. it’s not just a
random IP address for an FTP site somewhere on the planet, and if we think it
looks trustworthy we’ll go ahead and try it. In the case of the really popular
sites, like NuGet, I bet we don’t even give security a second thought; after
all, if big companies like Microsoft are posting content on there it has to be totally
legit, right? From a security team’s perspective, seeing how some of us behave,
I’d suggest that free, 3<sup>rd</sup> Party components and frameworks are like dancing
pigs [2] for developers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>OK, I get that executable content can be
really dangerous in the same way that granting my normal account admin rights
on the production system is dangerous; I want to be protected from my own
stupidity. What I definitely don’t get though is the apparent danger caused by
non-executable content, like blogs. Are “The Powers That Be” afraid we’ll somehow
become subverted by poisonous articles that will generate an uprising to
overthrow the management? Or are they just afraid we’ll waste time by looking
at the football scores which will undoubtedly lead to even more wasted time as
we argue over the relative merits of a <st1:date Year="2002" Day="4" Month="4"
w:st="on">4-4-2</st1:date> formation? If the worry is that we might try and
sell the source code for profit, then I think they have an over-inflated notion
of “quality” as plenty of the enterprise code I’ve seen would be worth less
than the <st1:stockticker w:st="on">USB</st1:stockticker> stick used to traffic
it!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Talking of admin rights, why is so hard to
obtain those on my local machine? Luckily plenty of software copes these days
without needing local admin rights. In fact I’m writing this on Word 2002 using
an LUA-style [3] account under Windows XP. Even modern versions of Visual
Studio play nicely, but there are still times when elevation is required by my job
– unless testing, debugging and deployment <span class=GramE>has</span> been
removed from my job description. Once again, what are they afraid of? Surely
the worst damage I can really do is screw up my own machine? Or perhaps they’re
afraid I’ll install DOOM and flood the network with <st1:stockticker w:st="on">IPX</st1:stockticker>/SPX
traffic? Is it my problem the company can’t partition its network effectively
to isolate critical services from those under test? Installing DOOM is not an
accident, but designing and building a service where it’s all too easy to
attach the development and production instances together by accident is equally
negligent.</span></p>

<h3><st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on"><span lang=EN-GB>Enterprise</span></st1:City></st1:place><span
lang=EN-GB> Developers</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The only other answer I can come up with is
that I’m “the wrong sort of developer”. Is the vast majority of software
development in the enterprise actually the writing of macros for Excel and doing
customisation of 3<sup>rd</sup> party products? If the development of custom services
(native or managed) is in the minority I can see how we “builders” might appear
to be so overly demanding compared to the “tweakers”. Perhaps there is an
assumption too that the modern technique of unit testing helps us to eliminate
all those nasty external dependencies and so reduces the need to do any sort of
system level testing on our own machines, right? In fact isn’t that why they have
a QA department?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>So far in this article I’ve pretty much
failed to be even vaguely objective, and that really was my goal when writing
it. We all know what the status quo is; the question is how to overcome it.
What can we do to try and convince those in control that to do our jobs
effectively we need the reins to be loosened so that we can access more of the
internet than our peers? Whilst unfettered internet access <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>for all</i> is possibly the desired end state, with a focus on
educating employees to act responsibly, I’m not convinced that’s a realistic expectation
for an enterprise in the short term to medium term.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Static Content</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>When it comes to non-executable content I
don’t believe we need to have any more rights than someone in, say, the
Accounts or Marketing department. In a large organisation with open-plan
offices it should be as culturally unacceptable to view inappropriate content
as it would be to stick Page 3 pin-ups around your desk. In an agile working
environment the demands of constant communication make it virtually impossible
to do anything other than your job as you’ll be collaborating regularly. And
that’s before you take into account the effects of pair programming for keeping
you honest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>What I suspect the non-developer employees
don’t realise is quite how much we rely on the internet to do our job. Whilst
there are the obvious vendor support sites for the core products we use, there
are also the big self-help sites like Stack Overflow. But even allowing access
to these is only part of the equation because often the simple answer is just
not enough and the salient details are in some blog post that is then linked to.
Like it or not blogs are the modern knowledge base for programmers so
categorising them as “personal pages” along with Twitter and Facebook is to
completely miss the point. When your job is also your hobby, which it is for
many in our profession, then the meaning of “personal” no longer distinguishes
it from “professional”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>When they introduced a draconian content
filter at a major financial institution I had recently started at, I decided to
seek out the team responsible for the change and try to describe how much pain
they were causing and to see if they couldn’t loosen it somewhat. After a few
days of quizzing everyone I knew I managed to track down a chap in the security
department and met with him to put forward my case. After showing some examples
of blogs that were clearly relevant to “the business of programming” he
accepted that the filter was too coarse. However he played the “but <span
class=GramE>it’s</span> group policy” card to explain why content categorised
by the 3<sup>rd</sup> party content filter as “social” was forbidden.
Exceptions, he said, could be made, but he also intonated that the process for
getting content checked and accepted was not a priority.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Later, back at my desk I noticed that any
content could also be given a secondary category. Knowing that the primary
category of “Computers/Internet” was allowed I went back to the security team
with a proposal. If I could convince the 3<sup>rd</sup> party content filter
vendor to re-categorise blocked blog content from simply “personal pages” to the
more specific “personal pages <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i> computers/internet”
would they allow it? They said “yes” and added that re-categorisation by the
vendor was much quicker than their process.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>OK, so this is far from the perfect
outcome, but it did feel like I had at least managed to make some progress as I
opened access to a number of popular blogs. More importantly I had found out
who to contact and got to discuss the issue with them. In the end I decided the
only way to instigate any further change would be to show how an outage was a
direct result of an inability to do my job properly so that there was a
monetary value to the loss. Unsurprisingly the right opportunity never arose
because I just needed to get on with my job and I’d got used to using my phone
to view blocked content instead. I briefly looked into trying to claim my phone
bill back as an expense, but that just created far more pain for me (being a
contractor) than for them due to the ridiculous paperwork involved.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Executable Content</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Access to static information is only one
cornerstone of our jobs; another is tools. This includes both entire programs,
such as the classic UNIX command line utilities, and libraries which we consume
directly within our own applications. Whilst it might be an interesting
personal exercise to write an XML or JSON parser, that’s not really the best
way for us to be spending our customer’s money. Component-level reuse is
mandatory if we are to create our own applications as efficiently as possible,
unless there is an especially good reason to build them ourselves (e.g. legal).
The same goes for tools – we shouldn’t be writing our own compiler or web
browser either.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>This rather thorny issue is probably where
a large part of the problem lies. Executable content is mostly opaque, except
for scripts or where you’re building it from source code, and that means it’s
hard to trust by default. Anyone who has ever been involved in a virus clean-up
operation knows how time-consuming it can be. Most organisations now run virus
scanners by default and although they do interfere with compilation and
development duties, the impact is minimal unless it’s set to scan everything
(which sadly does happen). One option to reduce their impact is to get a
company-wide policy agreeing that certain folders (e.g. C:\Work) or certain
processes (e.g. DEVENV.EXE) are excluded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Aside from a virus attack, allowing
developers and support staff to being able to run arbitrary programs,
especially ones they don’t truly understand, also comes with a risk of
consuming other resources, such as network bandwidth. One morning I arrived at
work faced with investigating why our clients couldn’t access our services. It
turned out we’d used up our entire month’s bandwidth allowance overnight. This
it transpired was down to someone not understanding how BitTorrent works. Aside
from the direct financial cost of paying for more bandwidth, there is an
indirect cost too in a loss of confidence by their clients.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There is also the subject of license
agreements. Most blog posts don’t come with a multi-page license agreement for
you to consume before reading on – programs and libraries do however. Ensuring that
your <span class=GramE>staff are</span> only using correctly licensed software
is hard. Apart from the obvious common collections, like the UNIX toolset,
there are many smaller, more specialised tools that we need only temporarily to
solve an immediate problem. However we might not even know if it’s the right tool
for the job without first trying it out – the classic problem of chickens and
eggs. If choice is going to be limited, then there must also be an
understanding that we’ll have to resort to using the wrong tool for the job and
that comes with a price.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The ironic thing is one of the reasons we
choose to use third party tools and libraries in the first place is because we
know writing security conscious stuff is hard and most of us are not qualified
to do that reliably ourselves. By increasing security around their employees
they have inadvertently reduced their ability to produce secure applications.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Black-listing dangerous content is never
going to workable, so the only recourse will be white-listing. The question is
whether it’s possible to put together a white-list with enough low-risk
software that would strike a balance between providing enough of the most
common tools we need, without leaving anything obvious out. Whilst the perfect
tool for a one-off problem might be a ground-breaking new programming language,
I’d wager the problem is also solvable, albeit with a little more effort, in
one of the more common, general-purpose languages such as C++ or Python.
Specialised tools definitely have their place, but they also have a cost, and getting
access to them is just one.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Local Admin Rights</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Disallowing local admin rights on a machine
for a normal user is a good defence-in-depth measure; it helps the user to
protect themselves from their own mistakes. But as we’ve just established
developers need these same rights because they often have to evaluate tools. If
they’re expected to handle deployment or do some form of local end-to-end
testing they may need to install, configure and debug their applications whilst
running as services. The alternative is essentially remote debugging, which is
a painful experience at the best of times. It also takes a test environment out
of action and creates a single point of contention which is the whole reason we
have our own machines in the first place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Once again the problem is no doubt one of
trust. The theory must be that if you allow someone the right to install
software, any software, they will clearly use it to abuse their position.
Whilst we’ve seen that it’s possible to create bigger problems by being granted
such powers, this kind of problem only goes to highlight a lack of partitioning
within the organisations infrastructure. Production services must be isolated
from development services and there should be some kind of airlock required to bridge
them; in fact this problem is probably one of the best adverts for cloud-based
computing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Ultimately though, if you can’t trust your
developers and support staff to be given admin rights to their own machines how
on earth are you going to trust them with the keys to crown jewels? I’ve tried
to have a grown-up, responsible conversation in the past to help establish
trust by promoting a policy where my day-to-day account should not also be used
for support. I was told that, whilst it sounded like a good idea in theory, they
didn’t have enough licenses for their 3<sup>rd</sup> party account management
tool to allow it. I then suggested that the cost of accidental failure would
probably dwarf that, but my comment was not appreciated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>If I really had to give up this right my (Windows)
development machine would need to come pre-configured with a bare minimum of:
Visual Studio, the VCS client, a decent Notepad replacement and Gnu on Windows
(or equivalent). Of course I’d be the first one out the door the moment the
contract came up for renewal.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Who’s Our Champion?</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They say every problem in Computer Science can
be solved using an extra level of indirection, can that work here? One option
would be to stop doing in-house <span class=GramE>development altogether and
just outsource</span> it all. That way we’d be working for a company who’s
bread-and-butter is IT and so they stand a better chance of understanding our
needs. Sadly the rise of Agile means that close collaboration with our customer
is called for and that puts us straight back into the client’s offices again, but
this time with even less influence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The other candidate for overseeing our well
being in a big corporation is the Enterprise Architecture team. These people
are allegedly the gate keepers of the company’s IT strategy. Their role, as
I’ve always understood it, is to look after the big picture and I can’t think
of a bigger IT picture than providing the basic tools that every architect,
developer, tester and administrator needs to do their job. Sadly it’s an
exclusive club concerned only with “design”; what programmers apparently do is
merely “an implementation detail”. Where is the equivalent department for us? There
is no “Enterprise Implementation” team that I’ve heard of.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The closet thing I have ever seen to
something like this was called The Technology Council. Their role was to try
and maintain a level of consistency across the various tool chains that the
in-house projects needed so that the skill sets of both its developers and
support staff were more portable across its applications. It also tackled the
licensing issue and potential impedance mismatch problems between applications
and operations. However it didn’t seem to include internet access as one of its
mandates.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The only other approach I’ve thought of
would be to take a leaf out of the eXtreme Programming manual and get someone
from the security team to sit with us in a pair programming kind of way. Then
they might at least see what we face and the compromises we have to make.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Whatever solutions we come up with starts
with us finding the right person to talk to and that’s often the first hurdle which
we stumble on straight away. Blocked content is usually presented in a “big
brother” fashion with stern words to make you feel intimated. Nowhere on the
page does it give you details of the person or team you should consult if you
feel access to the content would be beneficial to getting your job done and is therefore
in fact in the businesses own interest in granting you permission.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Summary</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>As a freelance programmer I live and work
at the bottom of the corporate food chain. As such I know I can’t begin to
imagine what it must be like to try and manage even a small company, let alone
a large corporation with thousands of workers, each with different roles and
abilities. I know it’s not personal and that I’m only being tarred with the
same brush as the rest of the workers because it’s easier to create a
homogenous environment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>But surely there must be a way forward; a
way for me to do my job without even having to contemplate doing things that
