<p class=MsoTitle>Afterwood</p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>The interviewer slid a pencil and a sheet of A4 of paper
over in my direction and said “I’d like you to write a little bit of code to
print a calendar.” I thought to myself “that doesn’t seem too hard”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This wasn’t the very start of the interview, there were a
few pleasantries exchanged before cutting to the chase. In that opening
introduction I quickly learned that my interviewer did not work in my department
or even my programming language of choice. His personal preference was for Java
but given that this was a brand new team with only a project manager who hadn’t
written a line of code in years, he was drafted in from another team to fill
the void. I let out a disguised sigh of relief as I realised I wasn’t going to
get quizzed about obscure C++ trivia.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I quickly doodled a picture of a calendar in the corner of
the paper just to clarify what kind of thing he might be after, and he muttered
in agreement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I then traced over the doodle again, which is odd, because I
never doodle in my log book. All of a sudden I became aware of the situation I
was in – a job interview. I tried to focus, thinking to myself “I just need to
write a function to draw a calendar; that should be pretty easy. He doesn’t even
know C++ so it’s not a language test; he just wants to see me write some simple
code.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The room began to feel small. Being a typical corporate
meeting room the décor was noticeably drab, this wasn’t the place you’d ever
consider bringing a customer; so it can be palmed off onto a bunch of IT
people. The lack of a whiteboard also suggested this was no place for
collaboration, which was odd, because so much of what is wrong in software
development is down to a distinct lack of this very exercise. Once again my
mind wandered from the task at hand as I begin to consider whether this omen
was foreboding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>More time passed and I’ve still written no code. This can’t
be looking too promising now so I make a light hearted attempt to cover my
tracks by suggesting it’s really weird writing code with a pen and pencil. Which
of course it is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I break the impasse by just writing a boilerplate function
signature “void printCalender()” and then add a couple of braces. I immediately
realise adding the closing brace was stupid, how can you insert code on a piece
of paper? Once more I make light heart of the situation by commenting on how
used to a text editor I’ve become. He agrees. I ask him to pass the “delete
key”, by pointing at the rubber just out of reach, and he obliges.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I need to get a grip. I tell myself to stop making small-talk
and get on with the task at hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally I seem to be able to concentrate. My sketch of the
calendar suggests a 2D structure so I start writing a pair of loops, one from
one to seven for the days of the week and another for up to 5 weeks. As I
mentally walk through the output I realise it’s just a stream and so I only
need one loop and some modulo arithmetic. I apply the “delete key” liberally
once again and focus on the single loop approach. Only now I can’t see what it
looks like as my mind has raced ahead to realising I have no idea what date
type I’m going to use, such as for working out which day of the week the 1<sup>st</sup>
of the month is, or how many days the month has, or if it’s a leap year, or …</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My vacant expression and another period of extended
inactivity has come to the interviewer’s notice and once more I’m on the back
foot. This time I bemoan that lack of a decent date/time class in C++ and
waffle on about Boost, time_t and OLE date/times. He sympathises but, probably
unintentionally, only makes things worse by pointing out how much you get out
of the box in Java. This time I joke about the lack of access to Stack Overflow,
or the internet in general for assistance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It’s now dawned on me that I didn’t start with a failing
test! Test-first development is still fairly new to me at this point due to
being knee deep in legacy code for years, but I want him to know that it’s
something I would normally do. I fire off a throwaway comment and try to gauge
his response but fail to detect if TDD is his natural way of life or not and
therefore have to let it go.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I realise I’ve just blamed the test process, again! Where is
the Singularity to swallow me up and put an end to this nightmare...?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Time’s up! The page contains some faint scribbles and I try
my best to elucidate my thought process, in particular how my gut says it’s
just a simple loop and some modulo arithmetic and I apologise for failing to
get anything remotely readable down on paper in time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He thanks me for my time and slips me a small piece of paper
with his email address on it and, almost as a passing gesture suggests I could
always contact him later with the answer. I know he’s just being polite though.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I trudge home, annoyed at how badly I’ve done. Similarly I
lament to the agent about my inability to write such a simple piece of code.
Naturally he’s supportive but it makes little difference to my self-deprecating
mood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The evening slowly passes and my thoughts turn to the piece
of paper with his email address on it. I start to ponder “was it a genuine
lifeline, or just an act of consolation? Is he merely offering me closure or a
second chance to redeem myself?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I fire up my computer and start bashing out some code. I
decide I’m not just going to answer the question, but I’m also going to do it <i>both</i>
ways – the two loop approach I fumbled towards, but also the single loop,
streaming approach I knew was possible. And I was going to do both using a
test-first approach for good measure!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At about 10 pm I zipped up both sets of code and mailed them
off. I was happy that even if he didn’t read the email I knew that I could have
done it given a normal working environment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The following morning I took the kids to school and just got
on with my life knowing there were other jobs out there and that I’d have my
day soon enough. Then the phone rang, it was the agent, “I don’t know what you
did but they want to see you again right away!”</p>
