<p class=MsoTitle><span lang=EN-US>Afterwood - The Final Page</span></p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Back when I started my professional
programming career the world was awash with paper-based programming journals.
At the first company I worked for they had some of the more popular ones on
circulation, such as <i>Dr Dobbs Journal</i> (DDJ), <i>Microsoft Systems
Journal</i> (MSJ), <i>Windows Developer Magazine</i> (WDM) and <i>C/C++ Users
Journal</i> (CUJ). On my travels as a journeyman I've also ended up discovering
a number of other journals that I subscribed to in an attempt to help quench my
thirst for programming knowledge: <i>C++ Report</i>, <i>Java Report</i>, <i>TechNet
Magazine</i> and <i>Application Development Advisor</i>. Sadly it wasn't until
the demise of many of these that I happened across ACCU and therefore <i>C Vu</i>
&amp; <i>Overload</i>. (I had asked on a company C++ forum about what printed
journals were still around now that CUJ was going the way of the Dodo.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The format was largely the same for each
publication – there was a beginning, middle, and an end. The start of the
magazine usually had some kind of editorial, which might be a simple summary of
the content, perhaps calling out the most exciting contributions, or it could
be more like a conference keynote – just some musing on the IT industry in
general. If our esteemed editor thinks she's doing a good job at avoiding
writing a proper editorial then she should re-read some older journals to see
how much an editor can really get away with...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Naturally the meat of the sandwich was the
articles, with a mixture of regular columnists like Ed Nisley and Al Williams (DDJ),
and one-off submissions from other people like ACCU's own Matthew Wilson.
Occasionally you had a little garnish, such as a &quot;Letters Page&quot; where
readers would email (or even write, like with an actual pen and paper, or perhaps
a typewriter) to the magazine to comment on some previous article from months
ago. Maybe there was a typo in the code, or (more likely) a disagreement about
the approach taken or conclusion drawn. Another common filling was the &quot;New
Products&quot; section which was often a listing of &quot;recently&quot;
released software tools provided by the manufacturers themselves. Luckily the
cadence of software releases was so much greater than that of the printed
publication so there was always something different each month.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In contrast the final piece, like some
editorials, was more of an art form in its own right. Where the editorial perhaps
appeared to have some constraints around it being a fairly straight-laced affair,
the closing remarks seemed to be pretty much a free-for-all sometimes. That
said they were related, though occasionally only very tangentially, to the IT
industry. With just a single page and less chance of putting off punters
browsing in the shops (the contents page being nearer the front than the back)
there was more latitude.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I'll be honest and admit that I didn't really
have the foggiest idea about what a few of the authors were on about some of
the time. That will likely be due to a series of in-jokes and references to
people and technology that probably pre-dates my birth, let alone my entry into
the profession. But that didn't stop me loving them all the same. In fact I felt
uncomfortable being on the outside, not knowing what those inside were savoring,
and so in a way it drove me to take more of an interest in the history of the
industry and its people. My own comparisons around the Kardashians and
JavaScript frameworks will no doubt soon become an anachronism too due to the
pace of technology.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Not every journal followed this format for
its conclusion though, or perhaps not for every issue. As an example, this very
publication (Overload) has, as far as my cursory sampling suggests, never had
an afterword to match every foreword. I was originally going to say
&quot;regular afterword&quot; but there <i>is</i> a pattern, albeit only once a
year, where the April issue sees Teedy Deigh pass on her own brand of
programming wisdom. <i>C++ Report</i> utilised its final page to carry on an earlier
tradition by hosting a showcase of Obfuscated C++ which was curated by Rob
Murray. Whilst meant to tax your C++ skills, or in jest to show how perverse you
could be with C++, it often felt scarily close to the codebase I was working on
during the day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Some of those that were given a platform at
the tail end of the magazine used it to have a good old-fashioned rant. David S.
Platt, the incumbent for <i>MSDN Magazine</i> (the modern successor to MSJ), currently
has a column titled &quot;Don't Get Me Started&quot; where he gets to let off a
little steam. Another notable grumpy voice from the past was Gary Barnett who penned
&quot;Angry Young Man&quot; for <i>Application Development Advisor</i>. I seem
to remember that he occasionally tag-teamed with Martin Banks who took up the
mantle under the subtly different guise of an &quot;Angry <i>Old</i> Man&quot;.
Luckily the arguments were a little more coherent than some of the rants you
see during the lightning talks at a conference, and in the end they soon mellow
out into &quot;Mildly-Displeased Columnists&quot;. Well, the British ones did.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Michael Swaine, with his &quot;Swaine's
Flames&quot; for <i>Dr Dobbs Journal</i>, was a more sedately affair. Often his
musings were played out as a scene between various techies that frequented a fictitious
&quot;watering hole&quot; in Silicon Valley that went by the cute name of Foo
Bar. I didn't know nearly enough about what was happening in that part of the
world to truly grasp whatever point he was making (if any) but I enjoyed the
relaxed attitude and the writing style made a real change from the usual dry
technical prose. Not content with propping up the back end of DDJ he also wrote
&quot;The Final Page&quot; for one of DDJ's sister publications – <i>Web
Techniques</i> – and I wouldn't be at all surprised to bump into him in other
parts of CMP Media's vast publishing estate. Michael Swaine, now editor for
PragPub, still appears to be going strong in the digital age under the banner
of Swaine's World.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Of all the columns that I probably
understood the least at the time, but still revered the most, was the bi-monthly
&quot;Post-Mortem Debunker&quot; in the <i>C/C++ Users Journal</i> written by Stan
Kelly-Bootle. I had always assumed it was a pen name which, given the style,
might have been attributable to someone such as Douglas Adams if it wasn't a
physical impossibility by then. It was also somewhat reminiscent of the
writings of John Gall (<i>The Systems Bible</i>) which I had only briefly glimpsed
back then. With the birth of Wikipedia I discovered that he really was an
accomplished author with a distinguished past-life in computer science. Oh, and
he was a singer &amp; song-writer too if the man wasn't already talented
enough. What made his writing particularly entertaining was his word play
against a backdrop of modern computing fused with some interesting tales about
what it was like programming right back at its dawn (on the EDSAC). I seem to
remember his footnotes were often a goldmine of little one liners.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The one end page that I turned to as the <i>first</i>
thing I hastily wanted to read, was Raymond Chen's &quot;Windows Confidential&quot;
column in Microsoft's <i>TechNet Magazine</i>. His blog <i>The Old New Thing</i>
(an extended version of his column) became the first one I read every day, and
it eventually turned into one of my favourite technical books too. Its name
provides the (somewhat obvious) inspiration for my own blog – <i>The OldWood
Thing</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Each month for his column he would pick
something curious about the way the Windows operating system or Win32 API
behaved and would provide some background material that would bring a semblance
of sanity to what was often seemingly perverse. Regularly the answer would
reach right back into the dim-and-distant past of 16-bit Windows, DOS or its
predecessors. Other times it might involve a backwards compatibility issue with
a product that was just far too popular with customers to alienate. To balance
things out there were also a few misguided design decisions thrown in there too,
but ultimately it's helped instill in me a perspective of what software
engineering at a mammoth scale is all about.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Back in those youthful days when the
printed page ruled the roost I wondered if the final page was a form of &quot;pasture&quot;
for old programmers. Hipsters hadn't started sporting beards back then and the
only data point I had was of Michael Swaine; I hope they'll forgive my
statistical error. Now finding myself in this very position I can speculatively
report that the end of the magazine does not appear to be correlated with the
end of one's programming career. If anything it may provide the catalyst for
indulging in a more elaborate style of writing.</span></p>
