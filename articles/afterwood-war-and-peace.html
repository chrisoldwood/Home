<p class=MsoTitle>Afterwood - War &amp; Peace</p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>After serving many years as the playroom (nay “dumping
ground”) the kids have finally grown-up to the point at which it can serve as
something a little more refined. The need to redecorate has created the impetus
required to pull the books off the shelves and have a sort out before putting
them back in what I hope is a more “logical” order. The room now takes on the grandiose
title of “library”, not by virtue of the number of books, it has less than
before, but simply because the ratio of books to other “crap” is such that they
now dominate significantly, and you stand a chance of being able to use the
sofa and chairs for actually sitting down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Having my programming books share the same space as the
family’s other books is a fairly recent event. Prior to this they were stacked
on shelves in the downstairs toilet until gravity conspired with Jeffrey
Richter et al to cause the shelves to sag and bow to such extent that they made
the occupants using the facilities as nature intended, to become deeply uncomfortable.
Richter wasn’t the only culprit, although he seems to have a penchant for
mighty tomes; other notable authors that stress-tested the woodwork included the
likes of Brockschmidt (OLE), Hohpe (Patterns) and Meyer (OO), with Robert Binders’
Testing Object-Oriented Systems the heavyweight champion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Book obesity is not a new topic to this journal with its
editor raising similar concerns some 10 years ago [1]. In what became yet another
failed attempt at writing an editorial Fran distracted herself by weighing the
classic K&amp;R book on the C programming language (375g it turns out) while lamenting
the “cost” (time-wise) of modern technical books. I’ve definitely got books
where even the index would weigh more than 375g!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the sake of balance I should point out there is an
upside to having 1000+ page books – they make excellent weights when pressing leaves
/ flowers or fixing things with glue that require continuous pressure while setting.
Such weight comes with great responsibility though and one needs to be careful not
to place the book too precariously, lest it slip off the table and land on one’s
toes. Fran may have used K&amp;R for her book scale, but misfortune has suggested
to me that the Richter scale can equally be applied to the pain level of bruised
toes as much as it does earthquakes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Putting the “technical library” in the downstairs toilet was
partly borne out of practicality. The desk performed admirably as a level 1 cache
but the latency of accessing the level 2 cache in the attic was dreadful, especially
in the evening when my kids were asleep as they played host to the hatch and loft
ladder. The shelves in the toilet drastically improved the (amortized) L2 access
time without disrupting the facilities due to a clustered configuration (aka secondary
toilet in the upstairs bathroom).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was also a slightly humorous element to using such an
unusual location as a library – my wife would suggest to visitors that it was
to keep them “hidden away” and avoid tainting the collections of Penguin Classics
and Dr Seuss. In retrospect I’m not buying this argument as when I was finally
granted safe haven with the rest of the family’s books they were still
relegated to the topmost shelf as if they were some kind of illicit material. The
extra reinforcement for the new top shelf may also have had a bearing on this
decision along with me, the tallest member of the family, being the only one
that <i>needed</i> to reach that high up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unpacking the boxes of books once the fresh lick of paint had
dried provided a much needed opportunity to revaluate the existing organization
which was analogous to the complexity guarantee for a std::vector – inserting anywhere
except near the end was time-consuming. Naturally I paid the price and ended up
with a retrieval complexity approaching O(N). (Sorting the books was very much
left as an exercise for the reader, which they never seemed to get around to…)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I can’t say that organising technical books primarily by
author, title, or year has ever felt natural to me. Luckily (based on my limited
data set) authors tend to stick to the same topics and, as technologies tend to
come and go, grouping around them ends up leading to a clustering based on author
and age as a side-effect. My programming career to date has largely involved writing
applications and services on Windows in C++ and C# so that provides three obvious
<i>initial</i> collections with only <i>Windows++</i> and <i>Windows via C++</i>
causing any immediate hesitation. But what about the rest?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What I really need is a book on category theory. I’m aware
that Bartosz Milewski has written one specifically for programmers, but the
trouble then is where do I file <i>that</i>? I already have Milewski’s <i>C++ in
Action</i> from the early 2000s so do I create a new category just for him?
Looking at the remaining stack of books they are largely singletons, although
design patterns also now stands out as a notable genre too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Naturally C++ and C# got amalgamated into a larger section
on programming languages which I did alphabetise. It all went swimmingly until
I came to the x86 and Z80 handbooks – do they go at the beginning under A for assembly
language, or the end under their CPU names? I did briefly consider making the
dilemma go away by redesigning the bookshelf as a circular linked list so that A
and Z would adjoin, but only <i>very</i> briefly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What’s left after that little exercise are a whole bunch of
books – old and new -- about a variety of software development topics covering
process, reviewing, quality, history, etc. with no obvious home. Hence, with no
self-contained sub-categories leaping out I’m inclined to borrow from J.B. Rainsberger
[2]:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Junior programmer's bookshelf: 90% APIs and programming
languages; Senior programmer's bookshelf: 80% applied psychology.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>…and file them all under a single section: applied psychology.
Sorted!</p>

<h3>Biography</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chris is a freelance programmer who started out as a bedroom
coder in the 80’s writing assembler on 8-bit micros. These days it's enterprise
grade technology <s>in plush corporate offices</s> from the comfort of his
breakfast bar. He has resumed commentating on the Godmanchester duck race but
continues to be easily distracted by messages to gort@cix.co.uk and
@chrisoldwood.</p>
