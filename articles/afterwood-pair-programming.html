<p class=MsoNormal>When I think of some of the most memorable comedy acts I
instinctively go for the partnerships, such as Laurel &amp; Hardy, Morecambe
&amp; Wise, The Two Ronnies, and The Chuckle Brothers. Okay, maybe that last
suggestion isn’t in my top 10 but they do spring to mind very quickly because they
are another famous comedy partnership.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Does this mean that the best comedy only comes from
partnerships? If I try and think of specific comedians then I’d possibly go
with Bob Monkhouse, Steven Wright, Jimmy Carr or Jack Dee. Of course the face
of the comedy act, the end product if you like, is the performance, the
eventual delivery of the stream of gags from script to audience. What we might
perceive as being a solo act, duo or group may just be the chosen form of delivery;
behind the scenes the people that produce the actual content – the writers –
may well be comprised of an entirely different number.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you’re bored enough to watch the credits at the end of a
TV show you’ll often find there is more than one writer listed. Even if they
acknowledge some writers under the separate heading of “additional content” you’re
still likely to find the lion’s share of the writing attributed to more than a
single person. It’s not uncommon for one half of a writing duo to be the most
prominent face (e.g. Bob Monkhouse and Ricky Gervais) whereas the other half
remains less well known because they are only supporting players in the
performance (e.g. Denis Goodwin and Steven Merchant). Naturally it doesn’t stop
at two, there are bigger teams of writers as well, but the point is that
writing (and clearly not just in the field of comedy either) is commonly seen
as a highly collaborative profession that benefits greatly from the input of
many sources.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So why is writing software, which is also largely about
communication, still often perceived as being a solo activity? Has the word of Eliyahu
Goldratt [1] (or more recently Kim, Behr &amp; Spafford [2]) about focusing on
product flow instead of programmer utilisation still not reached in to the heart
of the software industry’s extensive management culture? Or is it ourselves,
the legions of programmers, that are reluctant to give up our cubicles for fear
of losing our identity?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the past year I have done very little programming by
myself. The vast majority of my time has been working in a pair, but I have
also had the pleasure of doing a significant amount of mob programming too,
usually in a group of 4. I’m reaching a point now where the thought of having
to work by myself makes me feel uncomfortable because I don’t want to suffer
the loss in productivity. It’s still nice to do some background learning in the
comfort of my own space but when it comes to delivering product features where
the focus is on delivering working code to the customer, the joint effort is now
feeling like a more natural way to go.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The reason it’s taken so long (for me) to see the light has
almost certainly been of my own making. Back when the ACCU conference was
hosted in Oxford I remember a late night conversation in the bar (of course)
where I posed the question about how the productivity of experienced
programmers would benefit from practices like pair programming. The mistake I made
back then was to think of two programmers as two CPUs sharing a problem – each
additional CPU only adds another 60% (historically) due to communication
overhead. But reading <i>The Goal</i> (and more recently <i>The Phoenix Project</i>)
I realised my mistake was to think of myself as a resource to be utilised to
100% capacity, rather than leveraged to minimise the time to market of features
(and therefore maximise the value extracted from each proposition).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Whilst I had always felt that being able to help unblock <i>other</i>
people at the cost of not delivering as much personally was the right thing to
do (a global optimisation) the management focus around individual performance
always made it a choice which I was ill equipped to explain. Luckily books like
Laurie William’s <i>Pair Programming Illuminated</i> is becoming more
well-known and has concrete data to back up the anecdotal evidence which has
been floating around for much longer. This book, along with a number of other
sources, came to my attention via talks given by Jon Jagger [3] and they have
in turn been passed on to some of my clients that have also been sceptical of
the practice. Their scepticism, like my own though, is usually borne out of
looking for the answer to the wrong question.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I suspect is the case with traditional writing
partnerships, some work much better than others. Being a couple of decades into
my professional programming career I can’t know how it would pan out for more
junior developers but pairing and mobbing with experienced developers has
mostly worked out extremely well. It’s entirely possible that being mature
freelancers we’re not worried about climbing the greasy pole and so we’re entirely
comfortable with just getting on with the task at hand and don’t assume that
any criticism is intended as a personal attack. We all have different
backgrounds and that is something to be embraced, not diluted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Programming in a group of 2 or more is definitely a skill in
its own right. Just as with any conversation knowing when to speak and when to
be silent is something you have to learn. Similarly if you currently have the
keyboard you’ll probably be bombarded with “advice” and you’ll need to learn to
mediate. There are likely many things you’ll want to pick-up in the early days
of your relationship such as better ways to use the tooling and express
concepts in code, and that’s all on top of working together to solve the actual
problem at hand, which should always be the primary focus. Personally I find
the small scale scope creep trap all too easy to fall into and really
appreciate having “Gold Five” constantly reminding me in my ear to “stay on target”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One day I hope the software tooling world will catch up and each
commit can read like the credits at the end of a TV show or film where all
those who contributed to the feature are rightfully acknowledged, instead of
just the one programmer who got to execute the final commit and push. And it’s
not just the programmer’s names either; if you work in a cross-functional team
you may well have a BA and QA providing valuable insights and direction which
means your commit should be attributed to The Three Amigos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The world of software is still dominated by the names of
individuals, such as Linus Torvalds, Larry Wall and David Heinemeier Hansson. I
wonder if in the future when more of us start to work more closely with our
fellow colleagues whether we’ll see a rise in the kind of partnerships that
roll off the tongue, like Kernighan &amp; Richie or Pike &amp; Thompson?</p>
