<p class=MsoNormal>“<i>If debugging is the process of removing software bugs,
then programming must be the process of putting them in</i>.” -- Edsger W.
Dijkstra</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When it comes to most books and technologies I’m typically
very late to the party – the rest of the world has usually moved on just as I’m
getting interested in it. Somewhat unusually for me then, I ended up reading
the book <i>Coders at Work</i> by Peter Seibel within the first year of its
publication (2009). A natural consequence of always being late to the party is
that most of my books are second hand, so it was especially unusual for me to
own, and be reading a brand-new book. The circumstances that led to this seemingly
Black Swan like event were – my upcoming birthday, an online bookstore wish-list,
and a mother struggling (yet again) to think of a present for her forty-year-old
son.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I must confess that at the time I didn’t know who most of
the programmers were that the author had interviewed – I only recognised four
out of the fifteen names, and one of those had only entered my consciousness a
couple of months earlier at the StackOverflow Dev Day. As someone who
considered themself reasonably well-read this was somewhat of a surprise.
Fifteen years later I can still only tell you who nine of the fifteen are,
despite reading the entire book. It turns out names are hard in the real-world
too – remembering them, that is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Anyway, what I do remember most about that book was the
subject of debugging. Most of the interviewees made very little use of a
debugger, if at all, print-style debugging appeared to be their default technique.
And yet, based on their biographies and conversations, these people have
clearly all worked on non-trivial codebases so I couldn’t fathom how they’d
manage to live without such an important diagnostic and exploratory tool.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At that point in time my programming career had focused
entirely on lower-level programming languages, such as assembly language, C,
and then C++. My first experience with a debugger was with the Pyradev toolset
on the Amstrad CPC6128, although they called it a “monitor” rather than a
debugger, but you could still single-step through machine code. From there to
Devpac on the Atari ST, CodeView under 16-bit Windows (not forgetting the truly
awesome SoftICE when you needed to pull out the big guns), and eventually to Visual
Studio over its many incarnations (with CDB/NTSD/WinDbg making guest
appearances here and there). In essence, from my mid-teens in the 80’s right up
to my forties (and eventually on to my fifties), a debugger has been a
fundamental part of my programming toolkit, even as I moved into the managed
world of C# and .Net.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In contrast, the last five years has seen me working in an
in-house language that has no debugger, and so consequently print-style
debugging has become my <i>only</i> choice. This language is a pure functional
language, so memory-safety is not a source of bugs, and people generally write
small functions which are easy to invoke on a whim via a REPL. It’s a very
different world, and yet I still yearn for a debugger, not necessarily to help
fix bugs, though it would help reduce the time there, but mostly to help visualise
the flows through the 100K+ lines of code.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When my son was very young, he came into the office one day
when I was working from home and stood behind my chair and watched my screen.
Eventually he asked, “what <i>are</i> you doing dad?” I explained that I was
“debugging some code”. Later he remarked to my wife that all I did all day was
“make a yellow line move up and down the screen”. (I was using an editor colour
scheme where the current statement in the debugger was highlighted with a
yellow bar. As an aside that choice of colour scheme – blue background with
white text – also dates back to Pyradev.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He wasn’t wrong. Source code is inherently static, and what
a debugger does is to animate it. Suddenly the instruction pointer stops being
an abstract hexadecimal value as the debugger translates that into positions
within source files. Flow control stops being something you have to mentally
picture because the debugger shuffles the code around on screen as you enter
and exit functions and cycle around loop constructs. Most mainstream
programming languages feature closures, which are simplified by syntactic
sugar, but the debugger typically reveals what’s going on under the hood.
(Maybe motion sickness during debugging could be a proxy for code complexity?)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This idea of using a debugger as a code exploration tool,
not just something you reach for in times of despair is far from new. In <i>Writing
Solid Code</i> Steve Maguire proposed you also step through all <i>new</i> code
in the debugger as a way of testing it. In essence the debugger allows you to
take the same journey as the CPU before it hits production. It’s much easier to
spot an incorrect flow or off-by-one loop error when you’re watching the code
execute in slow motion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My move away from system programming languages has definitely
caused my skills with a debugger to atrophy. That’s not the only reason though
– Test-Driven Development has also given me confidence in my code in a way that
allows me to avoid firing up the debugger “to see it in action”, more times
than not. Even so, old habits die hard, and being able to fire up the debugger
and use a unit test to quickly get into the production code is simply the icing
on the cake and yet another way to unearth further test scenarios that weren’t
obvious from the static viewpoint.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I’ve never really understood the backlash against using a
debugger, as if “real programmers” <i>only</i> need print statements, though
maybe Chuck Norris is probably the exception. I suspect Brian Kernighan’s famous
quote probably hasn’t helped:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The most effective debugging tool is still careful thought,
coupled with judiciously placed print statements.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Of course, he wrote that way back in 1979 and therefore
likely suffers from the same malaise as <i>that</i> optimisation quote from Sir
Tony Hoare. Debugging Katas are quite a niche exercise too which doesn’t exactly
help their popularity outside crisis management.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Having someone take my toys away from me has undoubtedly
been a force for good as it’s prompted me to “think harder” (apparently that’s
not just for LLMs) and put even more effort into making my code easier to
reason about, but I’d still prefer to have a debugger in my back pocket for
those Lewis &amp; Clark style expeditions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chris is a freelance programmer who started out as a bedroom
coder in the 80’s writing assembly language on 8-bit micros. These days it's
enterprise grade technology <s>in plush corporate offices</s> from the comfort
of his breakfast bar. He also commentates on the Godmanchester duck race and is
easily distracted by emails and DMs to <a href="mailto:gort@cix.co.uk">gort@cix.co.uk</a>
