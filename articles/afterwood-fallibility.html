<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>When I was a boy, I got an illustrated
encyclopaedia as a present one Christmas or birthday. I wasn’t into reading
fiction and loved flicking through the book looking at the various cut-away
drawings of machines – both old and new – as I was fascinated by how things
worked. The one section of the book I remember most clearly though was a
picture of a man in a running race with a tortoise. The text described how it
was impossible for the man to ever beat the tortoise, if the tortoise had a
head start, because when the man reaches the point where the tortoise stood,
the tortoise will have moved on. While the book probably referred to the puzzle
by its more well-known name of <i>Achilles and the Tortoise</i>, I never managed
to remember that. It probably even mentioned this is just one of Zeno’s many paradoxes,
as I discovered some decades later via Wikipedia.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Being a child, I wasn’t capable of unravelling
the paradox and pointing out where Zeno “had cheated” but I knew he must have
because empirically I saw the outcome disproved every day on the school field
at playtime. And yet the logic in the simple statement made perfect sense. Despite
reading the various rebuttals numerous times over the years I’m still not
entirely sure I fully understand where the falsehood lies in theory, but I do know
that it does in practice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Over the last couple of years, the pandemic
has made me aware of some other interesting statistical anomalies as a variety
of people have tried to make sense of the ever growing body of data around the
effects of the virus so that models can be built, hypotheses formulated, and
(ideally) policy implemented to minimise its effects. One anomaly that seemed
to crop up repeatedly in the early days of the pandemic was Simpson’s Paradox. In
an explanation of its effects the particular example that most struck a chord
was a plot showing that “in general” more exercise caused an increase in
cholesterol, which clearly goes against medical advice. For those of you like me
not well versed in statistics the illusion here is that what you’re seeing is
just the natural rise in cholesterol as we get older, if you break the plot
down into clusters based on age you see that <i>within</i> an age group cholesterol
does indeed go down with exercise. The devil, as they say, is in the details.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Another popular mathematical puzzle which
crops up regularly is the Birthday Paradox, which has serious applications in
cryptography not just as a parlor trick. The problem is often stated as “how
many people need to be in a room for there to be a better than 50% chance that
any two share a birthday?” The answer is 23, which is surprising to a lot of people;
hence it’s commonly described as a paradox because the answer is
counterintuitive, even though with the right level of maths ability you can
“easily” prove it. Somewhat ironically, according to the Wikipedia page, the
reason it’s discoverer Harold Davenport didn’t publish his findings was because
he couldn’t believe it hadn’t already been published.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I think we programmers tend to think of
ourselves as a pretty logical bunch. The act of programming requires us to be
incredibly precise in our instructions to the computer, a device which makes most
pedants appear quite liberal. Our job involves reasoning about problems and,
where necessary, turning this into code which will ultimately be consumed by a
gazillion logic gates. It’s logic all the way down. And yet my take-away from
Achilles vs Tortoise is that what I think might be logical may in fact be
flawed because I can’t obviously see a counter-argument. In our eagerness to get
something working or a bug fixed we can fall into the trap of formulating a
hypothesis that can be proved correct when we should be finding ways to <i>disprove</i>
it, or in the very least putting the scaffolding in place to make that process
easier. In some respects, the practice of TDD borrows from the ideas of
falsifiability as it puts a focus on the testability angle of our code
(hypothesis). By making the code testable we make it easier for ourselves to
try and conjure up reasons why the code might not work correctly and ultimately
express those scenarios too in the form of executable code. Much as I’d like to
believe I can follow Sir Tony Hoare’s advice and “make the program so simple,
there are obviously no errors” I’m also aware of the assumptions that can eventually
lead to our undoing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Larry Wall famously described the three
great virtues of a programmer as laziness, impatience, and hubris. I’ve always
found the latter a curious choice as hubris is commonly used as a pejorative,
although I understand it can be seen as a positive force in some circumstances.
I wonder how many others misinterpret that quote leading to a lack of humility?
In contrast I find fallibility is a more useful position to take.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I once got involved in a support query involving
corruption of a cache file. The programmer who wrote the file handling code
reached a conclusion that there must be a bug in the Windows </span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Courier New"'>CopyFile</span><span lang=EN-US>
API rather than doubt his own code. While I would never rule that out entirely
there are many reasons why I think it’s improbable and I’d be looking far
closer to home before even contemplating such an idea. A quick trawl through
the parent process’ logs and I pointed out that the child process was now being
terminated for taking too long to start-up, ultimately caused by an increase in
the cache file’s size and I/O load on the remote server. This felt more
plausible and, more importantly, easier to validate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Of all the paradoxes in Wikipedia’s long
list, the one I’m finding easiest to relate to as I get older and more
experienced is Socrates apocryphal saying “I know that I know nothing”. Clearly
I do know something, lots in fact, but the pace with which our industry moves
it can feel like technology is the tortoise and I’m Achilles desperately trying
to keep up.</span></p>

<h3>Biography</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chris is a freelance programmer who started out as a bedroom
coder in the 80’s writing assembler on 8-bit micros. These days it's enterprise
grade technology <s>in plush corporate offices</s> from the comfort of his
breakfast bar. He has resumed commentating on the Godmanchester duck race but
continues to be easily distracted by messages to gort@cix.co.uk and
