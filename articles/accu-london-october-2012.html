<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>ACCU London - October 2012</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>Continuous
Delivery – Compared by <st1:PersonName w:st="on">Ed Sykes</st1:PersonName></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Continuous Delivery is one of those
techniques that I know what it is in theory but aren’t sure what everyone actually
does in practice. One obvious way to find out more about it would be to buy “the”
book on the topic – Continuous Delivery. Instead I chose a different route – to
listen to various people describe how they’re doing it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The venue was the Mozilla offices near <st1:Street
w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Leicester Square</st1:address></st1:Street>.
This was a new venue to me and it was a real treat to be greeted by hot pizza, and
fizzy pop courtesy of 7Digital/1E. The turnout was excellent with around 50
people spread across the chairs and sofas. Most of those were different faces,
but there were a still a few regulars to catch up with before the session.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Rather than a single speaker or set of
lightning talks the format <span class=GramE>was</span> 3 speakers each giving
closer to a 15 minute presentation on how they are executing Continuous
Delivery in their organisation. With a large audience clearly wanting to extract
every last ounce of information from the presenters there was a barrage of
questions after each segment that they deftly handled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>One of my goals was to find out what the
size of a “feature” is so that when I see the stream of tweets from companies boasting
at the number of features they’ve pushed into production today I have some
frame of reference. Luckily I didn’t have to wait too long as first up was
Chris O’Dell describing how the process works at 7Digital. Her team seems to
have adopted many of the modern practices, such as pair programming and <span
class=SpellE>Kanban</span> to create a very fluid environment. This wasn’t
plain sailing and they clearly still have some baggage to address for some time
yet. The most useful part of the presentation was the slides that walked through
a “day in the life” of a change, from development right through to deployment. Chris
left you with a feeling that they walk-the-walk as well <span class=GramE>as</span>
talking-the-talk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Next up was Ed himself with <span
class=SpellE>Cosmin</span> <span class=SpellE>Onea</span> to explain the 1E
approach. This is a company that seems to have to deal with a little more
“paperwork” for the final hurdle which I can definitely empathise with. They
had a video similar to Chris’s earlier slides that presented the change workflow,
but this time in a style more reminiscent of a production-line. Naturally there
were many parallels to the first talk, with automated build, testing and
deployment the common thread. A desire to avoid feature branches and focus on
small well defined tasks was also apparent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The final speaker was Robert <span
class=SpellE>Chatley</span> who instead chose to talk about how he has tackled
cloud based deployments. I suspect a fair portion of the audience is working on
systems that are, or intend to, run in the cloud and so this was probably
highly relevant for them. The crux of the presentation was about how to keep
that purity of deploying exactly what you’ve tested, which in his case extended
right down into the OS image on which the tests were run. He also provided some
tips on how you might go about switching over from one version of the software
to the next which requires a fair bit of thought when you have a considerable
number of nodes to upgrade and whilst maintaining a minimum level of capacity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Nice though the offices of Mozilla are with
its alluring fridges, it was time to switch to a more traditional watering hole
and continue the discussion with proper ale. Not unsurprisingly I discovered there
is quite a bit of latitude in the definition of Continuous Delivery and that
for some this only extends from DEV through to UAT. Sadly there is often some heavy-handed
“review” process in place to bring the pipeline to an eventual standstill. Even
so, I came away positive knowing that my team and I are heading in the right
direction and that there is still a wealth of tooling to explore to help
extract every last ounce out of the process.</span></p>
