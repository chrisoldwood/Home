 w:st="on"><u><span lang=EN-GB>Desert</span></u></st1:PlaceType><u><span
 lang=EN-GB> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Island</st1:PlaceType></span></u></st1:place><u><span
lang=EN-GB> Books<o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I have a strange feeling that I know why I
might be stuck on this desert island – it’s probably penance for knocking the
host of this column off his stride whilst he was giving a presentation to the
London branch of the ACCU. Unlike the heckling from the Henney corner that
night mine was a little more subtle. I forgot my glasses and so kept squinting
at the slides in what must have seemed to be a “very confused” manner -
actually maybe it’s not penance but sabotage…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>So where do I start? I guess I’ll follow
the pattern of my predecessors and generally cover the technical books first.
The music should be easy, but the novel is going to be pretty tough as I just
don’t read fiction books. As a child I’d have preferred a complete set of Haynes
manuals to the collective works of William Shakespeare; and as I saunter into
my technical library (aka The Downstairs Toilet) I find myself staring at the
moral equivalent – umpteen books on [D]COM and Windows’ internals. On a
pragmatic note I feel the most useful would be 4 of the books by Jeffrey Richter
as he has produced some paper based behemoths that could easily be bound
together to make a pretty sizeable raft.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Hmmm, I thought this was going to be easy.
There aren’t many unfinished books on the shelf (although I’m ashamed to admit
that one is by our very own Pete Goodliffe) so perhaps I should just take
those? Looking back at previous choices I seem to have some serious omissions. I’ve
been writing C++ for about 15 years and yet I don’t own a copy of Bjarne
Stroustrup’s The C++ Programming Language or Nicolai Josuttis’ The C++ Standard
Library. Come to think of it I don’t own a copy of the standard either; in fact
I don’t think I’ve ever seen one; then again I’ve never suffered from insomnia.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Anyway I probably shouldn’t use this time
to learn about a specific technology but <span class=GramE>perhaps</span> use it
to reflect on our profession instead – I’m sure I spend way too much time
‘doing’ and not nearly enough thinking about ‘how’ I’m doing it. And so we come
full circle and Pete Goodliffe’s Code Craft comes back off the shelf again.
I’ve read the first 75 or so pages and it looks like a modern take on the
software development process so I reckon it’s a good start. My 1<sup>st</sup>
Edition of Code Complete by Steve McConnell is looking a little outdated so
perhaps this will supplement it nicely. Plus it comes with monkeys, although I
suspect I won’t be short of those for company on the island.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>A couple of years ago I raised a question
with my fellow ACCU colleagues about what modern books there are on the Object
Orientated paradigm. I realised I had stumbled into C++ development and consequently
the OO world without really understanding the principles of the paradigm I was
supposed to be following. It seems as though the age old tomes by Grady Booch (Object
Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications) and Bertrand Meyer (Object-oriented
Software Construction) are still a force to be reckoned with even now. Hubert
Matthews chipped in with the more recent Object-Oriented Design Heuristics by Arthur
J. Riel. I’ve browsed through that and it looks very useful, especially with
the slightly different format, but I think I’ll go with the Meyer classic as it
covers the basics. It’s also another hefty beast and so should come in handy to
weigh down any tarpaulin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>In terms of shelf space Kent Beck barely
registers (he creates very svelte works by comparison) and yet I’ve found his
books an absolute joy to read. He has a pleasant conversational style that
almost makes you feel like he’s in the room reading to you (now that would make
a novel episode of Jackanory). Implementation Patterns in particular is one of
those books that really tries to help you get inside the author’s head. Some might
say much of it is obvious, but that’s only because he’s pointed it out. If
there was a Collective Works of Kent Beck available to satisfy these ham-fisted
rules I’d take that; after all I only read Extreme Programming Explained
because I enjoyed reading Implementation Patterns and Test Driven Development.
So let’s see what else Amazon says he has to offer, back in a moment…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Oh, that’s it really. But that’s good
because now I have another choice that I wasn’t expecting. Whilst on Amazon I
checked my ever growing wish list to see what else might inspire me. One subject
leaps out and that is to better appreciate what it is that my manager is
[supposed to be] doing. I digested Steve Maguire’s Debugging the Development
Process a very long time ago when I was but a junior starting out. Although I
thoroughly enjoyed it I’m not convinced I would have read it with this goal in
mind. Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams by Tom DeMarco and Timothy
Lister appears to be the classic text everyone refers to and so I’d probably go
with that as my starter. Perhaps when I’ve been rescued I could delve a little
deeper and try something more modern – I seem to remember that Allan Kelly
bloke having a book out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>So I’m down to my last choice and I’m
feeling somewhat guilty. I’ve only scratched the surface of The Pragmatic
Programmer (Andrew Hunt and David Thomas) even though it is considered an all
time classic and I know it’s packed to the gills with sound advice. I’ve also just
started Coders at Work (Peter Seibel) as the whole “Duct Tape Programmer”
debacle caught my attention. It’s a collection of interviews with such famous
luminaries as Donald Knuth. It would be neat if I could use that as my
novel-come-not-so-hardcore-techie-book because it’s a bit more touchy-feely
instead. So when I said there aren’t many unfinished books on my shelf what
planet was I on? What would be a really bold move is to pick one of those books
Jon Jagger was selling at the ACCU Conference this year; there was some
seriously weird looking titles in there and yet so intriguing at the same time.
This Software Business is way deeper than you think…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Actually I’ve known all along the one book
I was definitely going to take and that is Writing Solid Code by Steve Maguire.
This (along with Code Complete by Steve McConnell which is arguably a significantly
more useful book) had a huge impact on me and the team I joined back at the
start of my career. I know nostalgia isn’t what it used to be, but I still have
a great fondness for this book – most notably the anecdotes from Steve’s days
managing projects at Microsoft. I personally found the airing of their dirty
laundry particularly refreshing; it added a sense of humility and
real-worldliness to it. As the books subtitle suggests (Microsoft Techniques
for Developing Bug-free C Programs) it has less direct relevance to me these
days but I still enjoy thumbing through the pages of this (and his sister book
Debugging the Development Process) to read random anecdotes for the occasional sanity
check. Blast, now I’ve realised I don’t have room for Raymond Chen’s The Old
New Thing, and after I gave it such a glowing review in C Vu as well!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>So with my geeky side nourished I come back
to the thorny issue of what novel to take. It’s probably apparent from my
earlier comment that I’ve barely read any novels as it’s not a pastime I
indulge in. So do I go for the safety of what little I already know or pick something
I think I’ll like? There’s probably going to be a beach on the desert so I feel
inclined to pick one of those “best sellers” by Jackie Collins or Andy McNab. Not
really my scene though. If I can’t abuse the rules and get Coders at Work
accepted then maybe I should try for The Cuckoo’s Egg by Clifford Stoll. This is
about how he tracked down a hacker back in the 80’s whilst working at the Lawrence
Berkeley Labs. For a techie I thought he penned a pretty good book.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Now if it were films life would be easier
with anything from Sergio Leone’s westerns to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Michael</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Bay</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>’s
glossy sci-fi flicks to choose from. Here’s a novel thought (ha ha), perhaps I
should read the book of a film I enjoy – everyone always says how much better
they are. That would probably push me towards some sort of Philip K Dick
affair, but I’d rather go with something humorous. Douglas Adams vs Terry
Pratchett; it’s so predictable. Oh, alright then, it has to be The Hitchhiker’s
Guide to the Galaxy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Is anyone still reading at this point? Have
I managed to portray myself as such a shallow character by now that you’ve
decided I probably deserve to be marooned on a desert island to reduce pollution
of the gene pool? Good, then I shall hit you with my musical taste… Let me
start by pointing out that I’m a product of the 1980’s. It’s ok, I’m not going
to pick Spandau Ballet, but I do covert the keyboard and sampler rather than
guitar so anyone looking for more weight to the Purple Floyd vs Deep Pink or
whatever the argument was can go back to sleep now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>My love of beeps and squeals starts with
Kraftwerk, passes through Depeche Mode on to The Prodigy, The Chemical Brothers
and ends with a variety of DJ’s such as Carl Cox. There is also the occasional
diversion into ska, hip hop and rap. I suspect that a turntable would fair
better than a CD player in such a dusty climate, but sadly the vast majority of
my vinyl collection is in the form of 12” singles so I would have to pick
something like the Soft Cell 12” Singles Box Set to get value for money out of
my musical choices. With only two options available it would need to be a pair
of those rarest of albums; the ones that you could listen to relentlessly and
don’t have a single duff track that you always skip. There is plenty of house and
techno that I listen to relentlessly at work as I find it an enjoyable
accompaniment; the disruptive exceptions being Music for the Jilted Generation
by The Prodigy and Swordfish (The Album) by Paul Oakenfold. These have a habit
of forcing me to context switch in search of the ‘track repeat’ button. If it
wasn’t for my IBM Model M keyboard I suspect Voodoo People would have had to
answer for quite a few broken keys by now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>For “The Island” where solitude is likely the
order of the day, I’d prefer lyrics and big beats so I’m going to pick
Confessions on a Dance Floor by Madonna and To <span class=GramE>The</span> 5 Boroughs
by The Beastie Boys. Madonna has teased us in the past with a few cracking tracks
on Ray of Light and Music (and in secret I’ll even admit to adoring Borderline
from the ‘80s) but Confessions is 100% perfect pop with a modern dance/house
edge. The Beastie Boys on the other hand ticks all the boxes I’m looking for in
the hip hop/rap/humour department. It was a close call between Hello Nasty
(their previous best work) and Boroughs but the later has an extra level of
maturity and polish. Depending on whether or not my family are also marooned
with me I could allow for a significant increase in the swearing ratio and pick
Encore by Eminem instead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Let me finish with my own J. J. Abrams
inspired addition to the format by asking “What type of clunky old terminal would
you like to find in the bunker hidden under the island?” For me it would be an
RM 380Z as that’s where it all started.</span></p>
