<p class=MsoNormal>Now that people are beginning to venture out again some of
those meetups which have been in stasis for the past few years are starting to
reappear. I continue to work almost entirely remotely after thankfully being
turfed out of the office back in early 2020, and as such need to look closer to
home for some in-person programming related social interaction. Last year, somewhat
desperate to get out again and meet like-minded people in-person, I attended a
whole bunch of programming conferences, and that did turn out to be incredibly
soul filling, but also quite an expensive exercise for a freelancer. (The bar
bills were entirely self-inflicted though.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One meetup that resurfaced at the tail end of last year has
been doing several sessions on practicing TDD. Many of the attendees haven’t
done it before and so my presence is more for the purposes of networking and
lending an extra pair of hands. Even though I started practicing TDD almost 20
years ago I wouldn’t want to presume I have <i>nothing</i> to learn and, as
it’s done in pairs, I know I’ll always learn <i>something</i> when pairing with
a new partner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I hadn’t noticed until a couple of sessions in, that there
hadn’t been any mention of books on the topic. Back in the mid-2000s when I
first became aware of TDD there were two books which I immediately snapped up –
<i>Test Driven Development: By Example</i> from Kent Beck and <i>Test Driven
Development: A Practical Guide</i> from David Astels. It had been a while since
pulling either book down from the bookshelf but I remember them both being very
useful to me in getting a firm grounding in the practice and so I wondered if
their omission was on purpose, perhaps they hadn’t stood the test of time?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hence, before opening my mouth at the next TDD oriented
session, I thought I would go back and at least read Beck’s book again to see
if suggesting it would be useful or not. Many people prefer videos to the
written word these days, so the audience for that format was likely to be
small, but no video tutorials had been suggested either, so maybe there was a
whole conversation about what the modern authoritative sources are? (At the
time of writing there hasn’t been another TDD based session to present to, so
the answer will have to wait, for now.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Like many of Beck’s books <i>TDD by Example</i> is only a
couple of hundred pages long but packed with content. The first part of the
book covers the mechanics – the “by example” bit – while the latter looks at
the practice from a patterns perspective to explore the different approaches to
writing tests, forces on the design, refactoring, etc. Reading through his money
example was an absolute joy, far more than I remember first time around.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What I’ve always enjoyed about Beck’s books is the
commentary that goes alongside the main thread. It’s in this background
commentary where the real meat of the book lives. Even though the example is
relatively simple he is still forced to make numerous decisions about how to
tackle the problem, such as how to break the problem down – when to go forward,
sideways, or even backwards. He talks about TDD giving you courage and by
seeing many of the micro-decisions he’s making for each test you get to see how
that’s possible. One thing the book makes very clear is that the practice is
not dogmatic, yes, there is a surrounding structure, but there are different
paths depending on whether you already know where you are heading, e.g. Obvious
Implementation vs Triangulation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, in summary, yes, I believe it totally stands the test of
time and deserves the status of being regarded “a classic”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In contrast Dave Astels book tackles the subject in reverse,
i.e. concepts followed by a lengthy example. He has far more tooling specific
sections which has dated it somewhat. However, what his book really achieved
was to address the naysayers that exclaimed that you can’t write a GUI
test-first. Even 20 years later I still hear that argument and modern UI
frameworks are so much more amenable to being test-driven than they were at the
turn of the millennium. It also helped me cement the notion of <i>seams</i> that
Michael Feathers introduced in <i>Working Effectively with Legacy Code</i> as I
tried to apply the same ideas to a legacy C++ GUI application written using an
old-fashioned framework.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Should I be surprised that rereading Beck’s book was
possibly more enjoyable second time around than the first? Probably not, if we
consider what Italo Calvino proposed in his article <i>Why Read the Classics?</i>
[1] The article, which is a precursor to his book of the same name, lays out
what he considers makes a classic text. Of course he was talking about real
literature, not books on programming, but there are certainly many parallels. Number
4 on his ever-evolving definition of a classic is:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“A classic is a book which with each rereading offers as
much of a sense of discovery as the first reading.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Likewise, Number 6 suggests that I can probably look forward
to subsequent readings that will continue to bring pleasure and knowledge:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“A classic is a book which has never exhausted all it has to
say to its readers.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To date my attitude to reading generally sees me only make a
single pass through a book. From that point on I may refer to it again, perhaps
numerous times, but usually only to remind myself of specific points, such as
when citing it as part of my own writing. What I never do is go back and read
it again from scratch with the intention of unearthing new perspectives. Time
feels too short, and the corpus of programming works too large to dwell
repeatedly on the same texts, but that approach now feels decidedly
transactional. Even for some technical books I feel I’m missing out on the
opportunity to take the journey again, only older and wiser, but hopefully not
complacent.</p>
