<p class=MsoTitle>Be Available, Not Busy</p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>We all like to be busy; at least most people I’ve worked
with would much prefer to get on with something than just sit around all day
twiddling their thumbs. That’s not to say taking a break once in a while is not
desirable, or even beneficial, but that by-and-large we generally have a good
work ethic which means we want to pull our weight and make an equal
contribution to the team’s efforts. In essence if we’re always busy we can’t be
accused of not earning our keep through being idle.</p>

<h1>The Best-Laid Plans… </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>However anyone who’s ever had to employ builders to do any
non-trivial building work, like an extension for example, will be all too aware
of how detrimental busy people can be to a project’s progress. The extension
starts great – the builders are in full time so the footings and walls spring
up nicely and they move on to the roof. Then the unexpected happens – it starts
to rain – and the builders don’t appear that day. It might be for safety
reasons they haven’t shown up, or just because no one likes working outside in
the cold, driving rain when they could be doing something else in the warm indoors
instead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The following day it’s raining again and it’s a no-show as
before, fair enough. But by the fourth day the rain has stopped and the
builders are still nowhere to be seen, so you give them a call to find out
what’s going on. It turns out it was unsafe for them to put on the roof in the
horrendous weather so they spent the last few days on another job whilst
waiting for the weather to clear up. Despite the rain stopping they decided to
finish up this other job as it was only going to be a couple of days. Only,
this other job hasn’t quite gone according to plan either and the owner currently
has no windows so they really need to get that sorted before coming back to
carry on your extension. They’ve sent the faulty ones back and the manufacturer
has absolutely promised them replacements this afternoon…</p>

<h1>Different Strokes</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>And so it goes on. This is a classic example of how people’s
desire to be busy means that their own agenda comes before that of the project
– in this instance your extension. Your goal is probably to have the extension
built as quickly and cheaply as possible with the minimum of disruption,
whereas the builder’s is likely after maximising their income. To offer the
cheapest price and yet still earn income on days where work on your project is
not possible, they will find other paid work to do. The alternative for you and
them would probably be a retainer in the form of a more expensive overall cost.
Don’t get me wrong, I’m not suggesting that builders do not have our interests
at heart as I’m sure they want a successful outcome too, but that their top
priority and the customer’s top priority may not always be in alignment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This effect of context switching and delay often becomes
even more apparent as the project moves to completion. Once the structural work
is done and we move onto the plumbing, electrics and decorating then, every
time we have a handover or need a different trade, we may have to wait an
indeterminate amount of time for them to become free if they are not being very
tightly orchestrated. If the job is not done satisfactorily any rework may also
have to be fitted in around other client’s jobs and so the eventual date of
completion gradually slips back again, and again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So that’s how it pans out in small scale construction, but how
about for software delivery?</p>

<h1>Virtual Extensions</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are potentially different forces at play here because of
inherent differences in the two industries, but there are definitely parallels,
even when you have a dedicated team on a software project. Unless the team is
truly cross-functional with the full gamut of infrastructure and security
skills, along with complete autonomy, it will require collaboration with people
outside their control. The question is whether inside the team, at least, they
can operate in a way that reduces delays and maximises the flow of features.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Intuition tells us that if everyone is working as
efficiently as possible then the whole team must, by definition, also be
working as efficiently as possible. Hence if we’re always busy we are being
efficient (time wise) because there is no slack in the day. And this all makes
perfect sense if the aim is to keep people busy, but sadly it does not appear
to be the most effective way to get new features and fixes as quickly into
production as possible.</p>

<h1>Dampening Inertia</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is a moment in Eliyahu Goldratt’s <i>The Goal</i>
where there is a suggestion that it may be more beneficial for a worker to be
idle for 10 minutes than to immediately get on with the next piece of work.
This almost certainly sounds like heresy and goes against our intuition which
is likely why the characters in the book were suspicious of the hypothesis too.
The difference of course is that the work they could pick up now might not be
as important as the piece they pick up in 10 minutes time. If they start work
on a lower priority task and have to finish it, it will delay the start of the
higher priority one. Anyone who’s ever looked into priority inversion problems in
a multi-threaded system will be all too aware of how lower priority work can starve
the more important stuff when it can’t be interrupted. The overall effect is
that work <i>is</i> being done but it’s not necessarily the work we <i>want</i>
to be done right <i>now</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In software delivery we’re ideally looking to ensure that
the moment a piece of work enters the team the finished article pops out the
other end as quickly as possible. The quicker we put a feature into production
the quicker we can exploit its “value”. Potentially more importantly though is
that the faster we can move a change through the pipeline the quicker we can
remediate unforeseen problems and react to new customer feedback. Unless you’ve
got a product owner who paradoxically believes “everything is the number one
priority” then you will find greater riches in ensuring you finish what you
start, rather than keep starting new things.</p>

<h1>Small is Beautiful</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Context switching, as we know from watching computers thrash
about when they have too many tasks on the go at once, does not appear to be
the answer – smaller units of change (done to completion) however appears to
work better. If you’re used to working on features that take many days or weeks
to complete then it might seem impossible to imagine how you can break your
work down into such small pieces that they generally only last a few hours to a
couple of days, but in many cases you can.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For example refactoring work, by definition, does not change
the observable behaviour of the system and therefore is a candidate for
delivery into production the moment it’s complete. Similarly the use of feature
toggles enables us to deliver working code straight into production, even if real
users don’t have access to it whilst we iron out the wrinkles. Finally the use
of “spikes” allows us to decouple the act of learning about a problem from
delivering the solution to it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Outside of writing production code the modern programmer has
many other tasks on their plate too which can be separated off into distinct
units of work. These can be independently prioritised and executed, such as
documentation, updating tools, reviewing other people’s changes, improving the
deployment process, monitoring, etc. Even if all that is done and dusted there
is always far more learning to do than we have hours in the day so reading a
few blog posts, book chapters or articles about the tools and technology stack
is another excellent way to spend a very small amount of time in a valuable way.
Note that this should not be “busy work” work invented just to keep you out of trouble;
everything we do should be because it adds value to the product directly or
indirectly through improving the delivery process – “being available” does not
mean “killing time”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The net result of this decomposition of chunks of work into
much, much smaller units is that it’s easier to smooth out the flow because at
the huddle each day you can reprioritise based on the previous day’s events.
With really small tasks (on most days) people in the team are available to
either pick something new up or even pair or mob with others to help get the
most important feature out the door. If someone goes off sick for a few days,
rather than waiting for their return you could probably finish whatever it was
they were doing, or even repeat their work again because the time lost is
minimal and you may generate more disruption by trying to work around their
unfinished efforts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Being busy is a natural state that we will find ourselves in
most of the time, but that should be because the work we are doing is
effectively the most useful thing we could be doing at that moment in time. What
we need to be aware of is the consequences of being busy <i>all</i> the time so
that we begin to lose sight of the proverbial wood hidden behind the trees. Not
all tasks are created equally and some even become redundant before we’ve
started them so it’s important that we keep re-evaluating what we’re doing and
why. If you begin to realise you can fork off the latter part of a task into a
separate lower value one and finish early you will be available to trade-off
lower value work for something higher. Whether you actually do or not is
somewhat irrelevant, being able to is what really counts.</p>

<h1>Culture Shock</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Switching management styles to one that focuses on the
outcome of the work instead of what each “resource” is up to is hugely
liberating for the workers but also difficult for some to grasp. When a team
self-organises almost on a daily basis to meet the demands of the product
backlog it may be harder to know exactly what any one individual is up to or
what contribution they may make to any single piece of work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In essence it shouldn’t matter as long as the cost of
developing any feature is less than the value it generates, but given how hard
it is to put a figure on that for any one item, it’s even more important that
the team continuously delivers a working product to see how the costs are
measuring up. Always being available to work on the next most important thing
helps ensure that the money is biased towards the more valuable pursuits rather
than being diluted within bigger tasks of mixed value.</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal> Agility comes from being in a position to make a change in
direction sooner. To react to the ever changing landscape, which could easily
be a daily occurrence (or sometime less!) the members of the team should work
in a way that allows them to start <i>and</i> complete “useful” tasks in a
small period of time. Being more aware of what is going on around us and where
our current piece sits in the pecking order means we can make a judgement call
on whether to soldier on alone, call for reinforcements or even stop short and
offer ourselves up instead. If the spotlight switches from the people to the outcome
then it helps those people to self-organise around that goal when their
availability is higher.</p>
