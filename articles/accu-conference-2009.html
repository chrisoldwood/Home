2009 ACCU Conference</span><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>This was my second ACCU conference - my
first being 2008. Last year I was somewhat star struck as many of the authors
of the books on my desk were there. Of course they were all very accessible,
especially in the bar after hours. This year it didn’t take nearly as long to
slip into the routine of walking up to random people and chatting with them
over 1 or 5 beers. I also vowed not to stay up until dawn every night and
instead make every keynote – I almost succeeded. Another change for me was to
focus less on the technology and more on the ‘message’, which as it turned out
was pretty hard to miss in some cases...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I got into the swing of things pretty
quickly by arriving on the Monday night and taking the pre-conference session
on Tuesday by Alisdair Meredith about C++ 0X. I have been loosely following the
proposals for the next C++ standard on various blogs, but it still felt good to
have a leading figure talk you through the proposals, and how they interact,
such as R-Value references and move semantics. As expected he covered the new
Memory Model and threading features in reasonable depth, illustrating how the
Double-Checked Lock Pattern would be implemented correctly. The middle part of
the day covered some of the more settled features like unqiue_ptr, initialiser
lists, variadic macros and templates and then he devoted a significant amount
of time towards the end to Concepts – the other big new feature. I was doing
well, but I’m afraid he lost me when it got to discussing Axioms, luckily
there’s still plenty of time to digest all this before it becomes a reality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Wednesday was the start of the conference
proper and the opening keynote was from Uncle Bob about Software Craftsmanship.
This was an interesting and insightful piece about how we have attempted to
cast ourselves as scientists or engineers or architects and consequently have
ended up drawing some pretty poor analogies that has helped neither us nor our
customers. This also laid a nice backdrop for Nicolai’s keynote which was due
at the end the day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>F# is a new language joining the .Net
family and one whose blog I have followed out of curiosity, so I chose Oliver
Sturm’s “Functional Programming in F#” as my first session. After
double-checking with him first about how “heavy” it was going to be, I was
pleased to see that he covered much of the languages’ background to set a
context for its use. Using the interactive interpreter he walked us through
some F# basics, but its foibles as a statically-typed .Net language looked
apparent to those that were perhaps used to other more flexible FP languages,
so he didn’t get time to cover some of the more advanced features.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I followed lunch with Roger Orr talking
about Refactoring in the Real World. The ‘RW’ suffix was important as this
hugely over-subscribed session took on a workshop style as the attendees were
all too keen to share their experiences. Roger used rock climbing safety, i.e.
only moving one limb at a time as his analogy to drive home the importance of
small steps and the use of version control. As someone just starting to do this
formally it was useful to see how to avoid refactoring everything in sight when
you come to an old codebase that has seen a lot of action.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Michael Feathers and Steve Freeman filled
my afternoon with a workshop about Programming Paradigms. They took a simple
problem and got four teams of people to solve it using different programming
paradigms – Procedural, OO, Functional and Rules Based. The teams would then
rotate and implement a new feature using a different paradigm. The paradigms
were compared and Steve showed various implementations using Java to illustrate
how a multi-paradigm language could <span class=GramE>be</span> used. This
session was also hugely popular and even though I was only a bystander I still
found it thought provoking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>This year saw the day finishing with a
keynote as well, and it was Nicolai Josuttis that delivered a scathing comment
on the lack of quality being applied in the industry due to the marketing
drones calling the shots. The large dose of irony that accompanied his examples
did not cloud the underlying message which is perhaps more apparent in large
corporations than smaller software houses. It certainly generated a fair bit of
discussion in the bar later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Thursday’s keynote was delivered by Linda
Rising on the level of abstraction required to make patterns work successfully.
She pointed out the dangers of being too specific to one problem domain –
namely that other people will fail to see the similarities and discard them or
create a new, but very similar pattern, when in reality they should have
created a higher-order pattern that encompasses both. I found her account of
the POLP conferences shepherding process and writers’ workshop, and how that
differs from the usual conference format, particularly interesting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I decided to go with Phil Nash’s
introduction to Objective-C after the coffee break as I had seen snippets of
example Objective-C code in magazines and thought the syntax was weird, but as
Phil quickly showed (after a brief OO language history lesson), it isn’t really
that strange and I was quite taken with many aspects of it until he started to
describe the reference counting. Unfortunately time got the better of him, but
nonetheless he appeared to cover most of the key language features, and also its
reliance on conventions, which appears to be a big aspect. It was a good
introduction that has certainly grabbed my attention.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Lunch was again spent outside enjoying the
sun. It almost seemed a shame to have to come back inside, but I did for Hubert
Matthews talk on Modelling Archetypes. This was, much to my surprise, probably
the most enjoyable talk I went to because Hubert managed to bring into a focus
a number of questions I had floating around my head about lightweight modelling
in general. He introduced a number of entity types to represent certain key
concepts like transactions and roles and then proceeded to give them a colour.
He showed some example models and went on to explain how the various entities
naturally fit together, with the colours making it much easier to see the
structure of the model, and more importantly, to see potential problems.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>A short coffee break and it was back for
more C++, with a session from Andrei Alexandrescu about replacing the Iterator
concept with Ranges. His talks are always entertaining as he tries to get a
little audience participation going and you know that he’s going to hit you
with something cool! He didn’t disappoint as he showed that the iterator
concept in C++ has limitations that make implementing certain algorithms or
containers difficult or impossible. His solution was to replace the discrete
pair of begin/end iterators with a Range concept, which not only encapsulated
that behaviour but also vastly simplifies others such as reverse iterators.
Once again Andrei makes everything look so simple and leaves you wondering why
no one thought of it before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Another new addition for ACCU 2009 was in
store after the sessions – a series of Lightning Talks. These were short (5
minute) presentations from anyone about anything. A fair selection of topics
were covered in the first 9 talks, such as; Seb Rose giving a quick description
of the Rational Jazz Server, Didier Verna comparing the finer points of Lisp,
Jazz and Aikido and Mark Bartosik discussing debugging Windows applications. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Thursday night’s drinking had an extra
twist this year as Steve Love and Richard Harris decided to do a spot of
fencing in the hotel car park! They had proper kit and everything – not just a
couple of broom handles and duffle coats. But, what were they fighting for? <span
class=GramE>Tabs vs. Spaces?</span> <span class=GramE>Vi</span> vs. Emacs? <span
class=GramE>Honour?</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Due to an over-indulgence of Leffe I
managed to miss Friday’s keynote and instead started the day with a session on
Portable Code from Steve Love. He took a much wider look at what it means to
write ‘portable code’ by starting with the more obvious issues around OS’s and
tool-chains, but then introducing Testing as another ‘platform’ along with
external services and even developers’ differing abilities. Steve’s message
about how hard it is to write truly portable code was pretty clear, but by
following industry best practices where possible, we can make our code
malleable enough to easily cope with whatever ‘platform’ we need to write for.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Another pleasant lunch outside in the sun
was followed by the second talk from Andrei Alexandrescu - this time about
Cranking Policies Up. This was based on a Scott Meyers article, called “Enforcing
Code Feature Requirements in C++”, that heavily used Template Meta-programming
to attribute features to code, such as “thread-safe” or “portable” so that
feature incompatible code could be flagged at compile time. Andrei’s focus was
on showing why the C++ language, as it stands today, does not make the
technique scalable. It also gave him the chance to give the D language another
plug, by pointing out where it was superior.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>My last session for the day was from John
Lakos about Designing Good Components, Interfaces and Contracts. In true Lakos
fashion, he had some 470 slides (less than last year though!) to cover in just
90 minutes. He gave a whirlwind tour of Physical Design – as defined in his
book – and then went on to discuss contracts, in particular how and when to
define behaviour and when to leave behaviour undefined, perhaps using defensive
programming to highlight when UB has been invoked. Unfortunately, given the
ambitious size of the talk it overran and he had little time to spend on the
final section about the different forms of inheritance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I just managed to squeeze a quick pint in
before the second set of Lightning Talks. Once again we had another 9
presentations, this time kicked off by “Caring Will Only Cause You Pain” by Peter
Hammond which beautifully continued the theme Nicolai addressed days ago in the
evening keynote about the death of quality. A bit later Olve Maudal continued
the onslaught by using the analogy that you wouldn’t want to work in a messy
kitchen, so why do it with your codebase? And later still Mark Dalgarno also
tackled Nicolai’s topic of cut-n-paste coding by discussing Code Clones. In
between were other talks about Git, Scala, crime, character encodings and the
Google web toolkit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The Conference Dinner that evening was
another good opportunity to continue stepping outside my “comfort zone” and just
talk to random people. The principle is that the speaker gets to stay put and
the attendees switch tables after each course, and with Giovanni controlling
proceedings, no one is going to argue when it comes time to switch tables. I
managed to speak to a whole bunch of new people and talk to some speakers whose
talks I missed because of the annoying physical limitation of only being in one
place at a time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Allan Kelly kicked off the final day with a
keynote that looked into the management of software development. Using Fred
Brooks’ comment on the quality of people being more important, he introduced 9
principles (although it was 10 really as it was 0-based!) for better
management. These principles tackled balancing workload, relationships, quality
and risk which hopefully will lead to both happy customers and developers.
Although aimed more towards managers, he did pronounce that “Managers are not
Aliens” and try to get developers to be more aware of their managers’ needs. He
also managed to finish with the most blatant book plug of the conference (I
think it was called “Changing Software Development: Learning to become Agile”).
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>After copious amounts of coffee to aid
recovery from the night before I decided to join Klaus Marquardt’s workshop
called “Patterns for Versions, Releases and Compatibility”. Whilst giving his
introduction he produced a large ball of wool which seemed a little odd, until
we found out that we were going to discuss and list the various aspects of our
current project’s release cycle, attaching them to the wool to create a washing
line, of sorts, that describes the process. We then got to go around the room
and see how other people in other domains tackle releases and put love-hearts
or lightning bolts on any practices we particularly liked or loathed. There was
a good cross section of application domains to ensure this session had the
diversity it needed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>My final session of the conference was
spent with the bare-footed Pete Goodliffe discussing Legacy Code and how we can
learn to live with it. This was a talk about what legacy code is, how do we go
about understanding what it does and then how can we change it without breaking
anything else and hopefully improving it at the same time. The majority of the
talk was about the “understanding” aspect as he initially covered the wider
picture such as the build process, documentation, customers, testing etc to
show that the context of the code is often bigger than just the raw lines of
source code. Pete then focused on how to “map” the software to get a feel for
its structure, by looking at interfaces, dependencies, file layout etc. The
final section on modifying the code concentrated on testing practices, but also
touched on other improvements such as cleaning up old comments. He finished by
walking through a code change with the aid of frogs! I found Pete’s session nicely
put some of the recent books I’d read (such as Michael Feathers) into a bigger
context.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The sessions - the bit you pay for – are
worth every penny in <span class=GramE>their own</span> right, but they’re not
the only reason for coming to the ACCU conference. The other reason is
networking, or more simply, meeting other likeminded individuals. Every lunch
time and evening in the bar once again proved a goldmine as I met new people
and got to talk to a few of the speakers in a more informal setting. The great
thing is that you know everyone in that bar (well, those under 90 at any rate)
is there for the same reason – drinking beer and talking about programming
stuff and probably even the real world every now and then. I know it’s only my
second year, but it lost none of the magic I experienced last year.</span></p>
