<h1 align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>The <st1:place
w:st="on">Downs</st1:place> and Ups of Being an ACCU Member</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I joined the ACCU about 6 years ago. At the
time I was working at one of the large investment banks and was mourning the recent
loss of the C/C++ Users Journal on the company’s chat system. I much prefer the
paper based journals and, what with the demise of C++ Report and Windows
Developer Journal in previous years too, my rucksack was getting lighter on my
daily commute. Naturally the channel I posted on was about C/C++ and it was
suggested that I take a look at the ACCU. Little did I know there was also a
dedicated ACCU channel on that chat system too<span class=GramE>…</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>If someone had asked me in an interview,
before joining the ACCU, how I rated myself as a programmer, out of ten, I’d probably
have gone for a 7. I got a good start to my professional career working with
smart people and in a culture where continuous learning was promoted. Various
journals were circulated, as were books like Code Complete and Writing Solid
Code. After leaving the company to go freelance I quickly realised I <span
class=GramE>missed</span> the journals and books and so took out my own
subscriptions and started to build up my own library.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>By the time I had joined the ACCU I felt
pretty confident that I knew what I was doing. I had worked with plenty of
people and at a few different organisations so felt I could gauge roughly where
I sat on this hypothetical “programmer scale”. My focus had always been on
learning the technology as that what was interested me most – my bookshelf was
mostly filled with the collective works of Jeffrey Richter. Although I had been
“doing OO and C++” for the last 10 years I actually didn’t own any of the fundamental
C++ texts, such as Stroustrup or Josuttis, instead favouring the Essential and
Exceptional book series as a paper form of Lint.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>And then I started going to the monthly
ACCU London meetings and tagging along to the lunches. There I got to put faces
to some of the names in the chat window and meet some of the other members that
had graced the pages of the journals I had started reading. Up to that point
most of the articles and books I had read were written by US based authors, but
now I was starting to come face-to-face with these people. That was scary, and
yet obviously cool at the same time. What started to become apparent was that
maybe I didn’t know quite as much as perhaps I thought I did. One particular conversation
stands out as a watershed moment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I had just been to see Paul Grenyer do his
Boiler Plating Database Resource Cleanup talk for ACCU London. As was the natural
order of things, we went to the pub afterwards to chat about the talk and other
stuff. I had just read Michael Feathers excellent book Working Effectively with
Legacy Code and so was keen to canvas opinion. I started talking to <st1:PersonName
w:st="on">Steve Love</st1:PersonName> (who had then just taken over as editor
of C Vu) and it suddenly became apparent that although I understood the
mechanics of programming and the technology what I was failing to appreciate
was the philosophy of it. In essence I was taking what I was reading far too
literally and failing to take the time to understand many of the underlying
principles. In retrospect I suspect that this is largely the result of being a
self-taught programmer that was arrogant enough to “know it all” by the time
they reached University. You don’t need a type-system when you’re programming
in Assembler, and anything other than Assembler is “obviously” going to be too
slow…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>And then I went to my first ACCU Conference
in 2008. Before going I had definitely dropped a notch or two on the scale, but
what the conference did was to magnify the effects of those branch meetings and
lunches ten fold. The team I was currently working in were certainly as capable
a bunch of programmers as any, but they weren’t all the passionate kind.
Suddenly I found myself surrounded by like-minded individuals and quite a few
authors of the books on my desk. Now we’re talking scary, but oh-so awesome
too. Is it any wonder I didn’t go to bed for the next 4 nights for fear of
missing out on another mind-blowing revelation?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>By the end of my first conference, I was
definitely down to a 3 or even 2. No, what I realised is that The Programmer
Scale is not linear – it’s exponential! There is just so much more stuff to
learn. I really hope that nobody actually asks me to rate myself in an interview
because I’m not sure 2 is the answer they’re looking for and they probably don’t
know what the far end of the scale looks like either.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>What anyone who’s ever read one of my
reviews of the ACCU conference will have hopefully picked up on, is that
everyone there is so approachable and eager to share. Yes, we all have to earn
a crust, but it doesn’t feel like you’re in competition with anyone else,
instead it feels like everyone there wants to advance The Cause together, where
that cause is to be the best programmer we can.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>In the intervening years I have got over my
fear of asking what I previously would have thought of as a stupid question,
and in fact have learnt to embrace my naivety. Yes, there is a lot of new cool
technology to learn, but there are also the basics that we use every day and
yet might not fully appreciate. Hearing some “respected” individuals arguing at
<st1:time Minute="0" Hour="4" w:st="on">4 o’clock</st1:time> in the morning
about the definition of “equality” goes a long way to boosting one’s confidence
so that you don’t feel like you’re the only one who thinks the topic is a
little bit trickier than the books make out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Ah, yes, confidence. Some people seem to
have it in spades, almost to the point where a little humility wouldn’t go a
miss now and then. At the other end of the spectrum are those of us that need
constant validation and reassurance that we’re heading in the right direction,
or that we have a worthy contribution to make. The agile practitioners tell us
that face-to-face communication is worth so much more than a requirements
document, and so it is with learning. <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Reading</st1:City></st1:place>
books might help you learn mechanics, but I’ve found the essence only really
sinks in when discussing those concepts with others.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>As I write this my first <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>proper</i> article is about to be published
in Overload. I started it well over 3 years ago, and even though I was pretty
confident of the subject matter, I still felt uneasy about putting it forward.
Instead I decided to take smaller steps, firstly by starting a blog and then by
succumbing to “light pressure” from the C Vu editor and doing the write-ups for
the ACCU London meets and annual conference. At the conference a couple of
years ago I dipped my toe in the water and did a 5 min lightning talk which
seemed to go down well. The following year I found myself hosting an ACCU
London meet for 60 mins, and then doing a 90 min session at the conference a
few months later. This year I’m presenting again and have started moving ideas
from the “possible blog post list” to the “potential ACCU article list”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>After being a professional programmer for
almost 20 years you’d have thought things would have settled down by now. And
yet I’ve probably learnt more about programming in the last 10 years than during
the first 10. I’ve certainly learnt more about myself, and look forward to
learning even more about both.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I’m in no doubt that joining the ACCU has
had a profound effect on both my career and my personality. That has only been
possible because certain people put their time and effort into ensuring that
the organisation continues to function and hopefully flourish. Sadly I only get
to thank some of those in person once a year at the conference. Luckily though
a few others I get to meet a little more regularly and two of those in
particular have been instrumental in providing the reassurance I needed to get
off my backside and start to explore my own potential. Perhaps it’s because
they are the editors of the two ACCU publications that it gives them a license
to cajole, coax and entice us into making a contribution. But you know what,
that’s just what some of us need and for that, Fran &amp; Steve, I thank you.</span></p>
