<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><u><span lang=EN-GB>Jon
Jagger's Coding Dojo<o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Once again I found myself at one of the <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">London</st1:place></st1:City> offices of SkillsMatter
for an ACCU London get together. This time it was a CyberDojo hosted by Jon
Jagger. I didn’t know exactly what one of those was, but there were good
reports about the one he ran at the ACCU Conference this year so that made it
sound promising. Also there had been some chatter on accu-general about the
system he was building for it that intrigued me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The basic premise is that we were initially
split into groups of three to solve a simple programming task. There would be
one person allowed to use the keyboard (the driver) and two aides. After ten
minutes Jon would ring a bell and the driver had to move to another group, but he
wasn’t then allowed to drive – one of the remaining two had to take up the
role. Due to the time constraints of the event this part only lasted an hour
with a few minutes afterwards to discuss what happened. Naturally a few of us
retired to The Slaughtered Lamb to do some Pair Drinking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I’ll be honest and admit that I was
somewhat nervous at the thought of Pair Programming with a bunch of ACCU
members. If there is one thing I have come to realise since joining the ACCU
it’s how high the bar really is and I probably would have felt somewhat
intimated if some of the bigger names were there. In contrast I barely knew any
of the 10 or so people that turned up and that made it all the more exciting as
I had some unexpected social barriers to contend with instead. Still, rather
than throw caution to the wind and join two other new faces I spotted Allan
Kelly was also a man down and so took the safe approach and joined his group
instead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The setup was quite simple. Each group had
a laptop with some custom browser based software that provided a simple text
window into which you could write either unit tests or production code. Once
you were happy with each you hit a button and the code would be compiled and
the tests executed. You would then either get a green or red light. Sadly I
arrived late and missed the explanation about how the groups were connected
behind the scenes, but there was some kind of gaming system under the hood that
turned your actions into a pot of money that gave you an additional goal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The programming problem itself was quite
simple – format up an integral value into Roman Numerals. It’s the sort of
problem you would expect to be pretty easy, at least if you’ve been through a
round of job interviews in the last few years; but it quickly becomes tricky. I’m
not sure if it was stated as a goal, but each group took a Test-First
Development (TFD) approach and wrote small failing tests before adding new
production code. The choice of initial tests was quite interesting as some
started with the low numerals, I, V etc, whilst others picked the opposite end,
M, D etc. It didn’t take long for the easy ones (1, 5, 10 etc) to be working
and the teams to stumble on the key difficulty with Roman Numerals – how to
deal with the numbers just less than the main numerals, i.e. 4 (IV), 9 (IX)
etc. At this point, for some, the “simplest thing that could possibly work”
changed from a simple step to a much larger prospect as the teams started to
discuss algorithms to generalise the solution; others seemed happy to keep
solving each little case and try and continue taking small steps.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The 10 minute rotation now became more of a
distraction as you were in the middle of a ‘design meeting’ when you found
yourself needing to stop and bring the newest member of the team up to speed,
or you became the outsider and had to integrate with a new order. Near the end
word spread of a fresh lead involving special cases of numeral pairs and some
members were trying to explain their findings to their team mates when Jon
called time. Throw into the mix a subtle change in programming language
(Java/C#) and that fact that The Driver may not even have written code in one
of these curly brace languages, or even be used to the Imperative paradigm for
that matter and you can see why so little production code was written in those
short 60 minutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Of course we all know that Lines of Code is
no measure of success and what really mattered was the team dynamics. For
example one team was initially isolated in the opposite corner of the room and
no one noticed when it came time to swap – so they were left with the same
pairing until Jon stepped in. Surprisingly there were no big egos, if anything
people were all a little too polite; perhaps that’s a symptom of a largely
anonymous group whereas if we all worked together some of us would have felt
more comfortable taking a more leading position.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Perhaps if more teams switched one of their
team-building events from paint-balling or bowling to one of Jon’s CyberDojos
they might build more than just morale.</span></p>
