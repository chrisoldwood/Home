<p class=MsoNormal>There can’t be many three-letter words that can cause the
average programmer to break out into a cold sweat, but the word “tab” must
surely feature fairly highly among them. I can imagine the word “for” would
cause a functional programming evangelist to give a little shudder given their
dislike for explicit iteration, and the abbreviation “int” must surely generate
a lengthy sigh from anyone that’s had to write cross-platform code in C or its
closest brethren, C++. However “tab” cuts across paradigms and languages and
holds a special place in our psyche.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A rather popular sci-fi TV programme tells us that “space”
is the final frontier and, for typists around 1900, that was certainly a major
challenge they faced. If you think positioning text with CSS can be arduous at
times try laying out a table of data on an old-fashioned typewriter. Repeatedly
pressing the space bar and backspace keys to line up the cursor is going test
anyone’s patience, and that’s before you factor in the effort each keystroke requires
on such a mechanical device. RSI is an initialism so it’s exempt from this particular
discourse but the tab key must be congratulated here on its stress reducing
measures.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It’s funny to think that something we can’t actually see
would cause us programmers so much distress and yet, like a black hole, it has
the ability to distort that which surrounds it. How many times have you inserted
a space early in a line only for the remainder to spring exponentially further
to the right as a gaping chasm opens up from nowhere; it’s like a kerning
disaster on a grander scale. They also say beauty is in the eye of the beholder
but no one in their right mind would choose to use 8 spaces for indentation,
but apparently, historically, that’s what the world once thought was considered
Good Taste™.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My first foray into the world of Python left me with a scar
I still bear to this very day and which came courtesy of the invisible enemy.
After starting my first non-trivial Python program in the (then) new-fangled
IDLE Python IDE, I quickly switched to the more comfortable Visual Studio text
editor to finish my sysadmin masterpiece. Sadly I wasted the following hour and
a half scratching my head and debugging until I discovered the cruel lesson
from the school of hard knocks about mixing tabs and spaces in the same Python block.
I had forgotten that back then in Washington the space was out of favour, there,
the acronym TARDIS probably stood for Tabs Are Redmond’s Default Indentation
Style, and so lines of Python code were being skipped or executed in a seemingly
arbitrary fashion. Goto Fail, do not pass Go.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Of course</i> tabs are bad for you. Anyone who grew up in
north-east England knew that because tabs are a slang word for cigarettes. If
you believe the oft-quoted 10 lines of code per developer per day, then,
assuming a low degree of nesting you should easily keep your habit under
20-a-day, but the rock-star programmers are probably chain-smoking their way to
a very early grave. And that’s before we’ve even considered their late-night
coding antics where they might drop a tab or two of some illicit drug to fuel their
spree. To them an ACID guarantee is an entirely different prospect. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unsurprisingly I approached F#, another whitespace-sensitive
language, with a little more trepidation. However, learning from the mistakes
of their forefathers the F# designers just banned tabs by default, which seems very
sensible. If you really <i>want</i> to shoot yourself in the foot and use tabs
you can, but you need a special disclaimer at the top of every file to waive
your rights to any form of support on Stack Overflow. It’s not just your life
you’re wrecking – friends don’t let friends use tabs, ever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just when you think the eternal war between tabs and spaces
is beginning to decline as the ever growing list of vets speaks out over the
folly of choice and the remaining battles diminish to a few skirmishes on the
outer rim of the Internet, a new programming language comes along and tips
petrol over the smouldering embers. Google’s Go is a highly opinionated
language that’s not afraid to upset anyone’s apple cart, and the de-facto
choice of using tabs for indentation is just one major example of this.
Actually that’s not entirely true, the language itself is just as tolerant of
ugly code as any other – it’s the community that’s decided to embrace a common
standard. On matters of style the bundled <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>go
fmt</span> tool is judge, jury and re-formatter. Expect your pull requests to
become bantha fodder if your whitespace is not whiter than white.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This isn’t the first time a large corporation has tried to
sell the tab to a sceptical market. Back in the late 1970’s the Coca-Cola
Company brought TaB to the UK in the hope of capturing a slice of the diet soda
market. It was rebranded TaB Clear before I was old enough to appraise it, but it
didn’t last long – disappearing along with Cadbury’s Fuse. I guess the buying
public wants to see something for their money.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It’s not all doom-and-gloom for the humble tab. In the early
2000’s, as the Internet was really taking off big-time, the modern developer found
themselves in a new kind of hell. The ever-growing Internet started to become
the predominant source of developer information and so it was not uncommon to
have multiple browser instances open, switching back-and-forth as we pieced
together the answers to our puzzle. Although Opera sported an MDI style UI it
was not really until the new mainstream contender to the browser throne –
Firefox – appeared that the browser tab really took off and reduced the number
of task bar icons back to a sustainable cognitive load.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although heralded as the saviour of the browser, the tab as
a UI element was not without its detractors. The tab fad really started to take
off in the early 90’s as the Office suites began to look for alternatives to
MDI and cluttered configuration dialogs. The Interface Hall of Shame has plenty
of examples of where the wheels fell off. For the browser however the real
elephant in the room was a poor security record and a need to isolate each web
site into its own process. Suddenly each new tab meant another multi-megabyte
process and ever more strain on the humble computer. But it isn’t just browsers;
even native apps like Slack with essentially a tab per team are using
process-level isolation and hogging resources; it’s not uncommon to find Chrome
and Slack duking it out behind the scenes on a developer’s laptop apparently
striving for global domination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tabs also featured as a data compression technique for the
minification of JavaScript code back in the early days of the web, it was a
laudable effort, but with the average page now weighing in at 2.5 MB these days
it’s negligible. Besides, JavaScript is largely unreadable for other reasons
than just lack of whitespace.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, <i>all</i> tabs are evil, right? Well maybe not, there
is one category of tab that actually seems to be useful and pretty much side-effect
free – guitar tabs. For those of us who’s only musical ability stems from
playing Guitar Hero, the guitar tab provides a lifeline for learning to play the
classics without having to grok some ancient music notation first. Maybe the
tab has a stairway to heaven after all.</p>
