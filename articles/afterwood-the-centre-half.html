<p class=MsoTitle>Afterwood - The Centre Half</p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>As a child I loved playing football (nay soccer). Every
waking moment was an opportunity to get outside and play football. At school,
lessons and lunch were merely a chance to catch my breath before heading back
outside again at break or lunch time to play another game. The school holidays
were a Utopia where football could be played from dawn to dusk with no
pointless interruptions, like lessons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first real distraction to put a significant dent in my
football time was when the father of a school friend built himself a ZX81 from
a kit and we got to play on it one summer. The discovery that my
next-door-but-one neighbour had a ZX80 sitting idle in their attic nibbled into
more of that time, while the remainder slowly became a victim to an increase in
swimming training until football became the exception instead of the norm. It
wasn’t until starting my first proper job at a software house where they played
football together after-hours that I got my boots down from the attic and
rekindled my love for the beautiful game.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I never played as a striker, even as a child, so I resumed
my previous position in the defensive line, sometimes as a left- or right-back,
but mostly as a centre-half or sweeper. This position tends to be frequented by
players who are tall and reasonably well built and hence it can earn them the
somewhat dubious title of “Big Man at the Back”. Naturally from such a central
position you have a good view of the field of play and can coordinate the
surrounding defenders and mid-fielders. Each player acts with a high degree of
autonomy, adapting to the local conditions as the opposing team surges forward,
but the centre-half also has one eye on the rest of the field so that the
defence can adjust itself to the changing face of an attack.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Having never played (adult-wise) at anything more than
Sunday League football (i.e. “pub” football) I have no idea if this is how a
real centre-half plays or is even supposed to play; it just felt natural to
play that way. As a professional programmer I have found myself gravitating
towards a similar role with the various teams I’ve worked in over the last
couple of decades. If we consider the goal to be the delivery of bug fixes and
new features – the crowd-pleasing items – while the opponent is the background
noise of complexity, tooling, deployment, documentation, process, etc. then
you’ll usually find me tackling the latter rather than ramming home the former.
Naturally I’ll surface around the 6-yard box every now and then for corners and
free-kicks but I’m just as happy with an assist as a name on the score-sheet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While in the early years my own skills were growing in many
directions as I uncovered the mountain of things to learn, once I had a grasp
of the basic mechanics of programming I found more time to comprehend many of
the more peripheral duties which make the sustained delivery of software hard.
While it was never a conscious decision at first it always seemed more
important to help colleagues out, where possible, rather than plough on with my
own assigned work uninterrupted. Before I’d even heard of pair or mob
programming I was in no doubt that I had a far more enjoyable time working with
other people and so to be more knowledgeable in those areas that others were
less interested in gave me an opportunity to work more closely with other
people. Naturally it’s a two-way street and, much as I enjoy reading, learning
off other people feels for more effective.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While I’m happy to “watch their backs” and help the team,
and by extension the company, reach a global maxima it’s not a position that
sits well within many large organisations due to the way they assess progress
and performance. When working in a small team that sits together where the
management can see you physically wandering around the desks or standing
debating with colleagues across the partition it gives a very concrete view of
collaboration which no doubts helps promote your value to the team, even if
your personal goal tally for the season is a little on the low end.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When working entirely remotely this advantage disappears –
out of sight, out of mind. With no physical presence to rely on a management
team that relies solely on metrics, perhaps one metric in particular, like the
number of JIRA tickets closed, is likely to form a less than flattering picture
of your productivity or “value” to the team. Lest you think an organisation
would be foolish to consider this approach any more valid than counting lines
of code or number of commits; trust me, it happens. Hearing phrases like “they
have their own work to do” should be considered a free-kick on the edge of the
penalty box. Ultimately such times of madness demand us to summon Charles
Goodhart and game the system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As a proponent of the Russian proverb “trust, but verify” I
do not expect anyone to blindly trust me any more than I expect someone to be
watching my every move. Trust is also a two-way street and I expect any
verifier to look past arbitrary metrics and find the fingerprints that the team
leaves behind in the commit log, meetings, documentation, chat channels, etc.
If someone is having an impact their presence <i>will</i> be observable despite
the best efforts of some products to cling to the outdated notion of one person
one task.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I might have finally reached an age where nature has convinced
me to hang up my boots again for good but it’s not changed my position.
Software teams run more smoothly when they have someone that can read the game
well and provide backup and support when necessary to help them get the results
they’re after.</p>
