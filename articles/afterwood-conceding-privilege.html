<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='text-align:right'><i>“Welcome, to the
real world.” – Morpheus (The Matrix)</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Whenever I hear someone mention privileged people on TV it
tends to be in reference to some upper class twit that went to one of the famous
British public schools and has now found themselves in a compromising
situation. The term &quot;privileged&quot; is almost always used as a
pejorative because it implies that the person has had access to the best
education and support that money can buy and yet they have still managed to
make a complete mess of things. Even if they haven’t done something considered
illegal, the chances are they’ve done something immoral or unethical instead, probably
using their privileged status to gain access to the kinds of “services” outside
the reach of the general population either due to its cost, or clandestine
nature.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I never went to Eton or Harrow and don’t have a drop of
royal blood in me so I definitely wouldn’t consider myself part of <i>that</i> kind
of privileged society. I’m perfectly happy to snigger at their hapless mistakes
and frown upon their illicit deeds as much as anyone else. But not that long
ago I came down to earth with somewhat of a bump when I discovered how incredibly
privileged I really am. I don’t mean I suddenly discovered I was a hereditary
peer or heir to a long lost rich relative, just that I realized the term
“privilege”, like so many things in life, actually forms a sliding scale. It
seems I haven’t really been paying attention to how it affects both me and,
more importantly, those I come into contact with directly, or even indirectly,
through the virtual medium of social networks, forums, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My cosy bubble burst when a tweet from a rather well-known (and
often highly respected) member of the software engineering community got
injected into my feed, which stated that politics just weren’t that important.
This was at a time when there was an ongoing discussion about whether it was
desirable or not to keep politics out of a person’s timeline that was normally
reserved for more technical content. As someone who sympathized with this separation
to some degree (at the time) I was somewhat intrigued to see the replies. One
of the first in the thread lambasted the original poster by stating that only
someone in such a privileged position as theirs could even <i>afford</i> to
ignore politics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And in that moment I started to comprehend where I too sat
on the scale and the wave of discomfort caused me to ponder what side-effects
my ambivalence might have had on others. In my naivety I would have liked to
believe that my decision to eschew politics in the workplace would ensure my
impartiality and therefore keep my life simple. After all, one of the many reasons
to become a freelancer in the first place and remain a “lowly” developer was to
endeavour to remain near the bottom of the food chain and free of organisational
concerns. Instead I’m now becoming uneasy that my choice of ignorance has in
fact led me to become complicit, to <i>some</i> degree, through inaction. To discover
someone has suffered when it might have been within my power to help is
unsettling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As a middle-aged, white, heterosexual, British male it
appears to be incredibly easy to remain oblivious to what is going on to many
less privileged souls, both in the workplace and in supposedly “social” settings.
By unconsciously reinforcing the patriarchy through tending to follow the overwhelmingly
male technical leaders and “influencers” you could easily be forgiven for not
seeing first-hand much of the direct (and indirect) abuse and dismissive
behaviour that so many other people inside (and outside) our industry suffer
from. Lest you think it’s implausible that someone can remain in the dark for
so long the world of programming provides the perfect escape, especially when
one is lucky enough to get into it at an early age through the privilege of a
computer at home. With so much interesting stuff to learn it’s all too easy to
prioritise one’s education efforts around the latest tech stack instead of,
say, reading <i>The Psychology of Computer Programming</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hence, is it any wonder that we get seduced by the apparent
logical “utopia” of the Meritocracy when we strive for technical excellence to
the detriment of our other skills? I’ve undoubtedly been guilty of choosing the
“best” person for a job by focusing too heavily on technical merit which has
probably been reinforced by various biases that come from my own more
privileged background. For example I know in the past I’ve looked far more
favourably on those candidates that have shown an interest in programming
outside their working life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was well over 10 years before I met my first female
programmer; none other than the editor of this very journal. Such was the
status quo of working in a male dominated industry that I completely failed to
notice the spelling of “Frances” and incorrectly used the male spelling in our
first few email exchanges! I might have tried downplaying this kind of faux pas
in the past, as I would have other spelling mistakes, but I now see it as the
result of laziness on my part – the very least I can do is pay attention and
address someone correctly without making assumptions about their gender.
Details matter, especially when the repercussions reinforce such an imbalance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By making a special effort to listen to conference talks on
diversity, inclusion, mental health, etc. and through following other people that
freely mix their technical and personal experiences I’m slowly turning more of my
unconscious incompetence into some form of competence. The <i>Geek Feminism
Wiki</i> [1] has been an excellent starting point, especially the topics of
micro-aggressions, silencing and derailment which tend to be quite subtle in
nature. Hopefully along the way I’ll try and balance out my technical and
social skills somewhat more evenly so that I can use my new found position of
privilege to better effect.</p>
