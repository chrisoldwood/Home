=============================

Unless you're working by yourself on a throwaway program, delivering software
requires more than simply writing some code and running a few tests. Software is
only every done when it's decommissioned and the last user uninstalls it, until
then it will be subject to continuous change as either the users find new and
interesting problems to solve or the environment around it evolves. The only
constant is change and the question is how do we do that safely?

This segment looks at what it takes to go from "works on my machine" to
"shipped". Along the way we'll look into why tools and automation are essential
but, more importantly, why team communication sits at the heart of the problem.
