<h1 align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>Being Original</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>A few years ago I decided to take some time
off after completing another long contract and having reached 10 years of
commuting into <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">London</st1:City></st1:place>.
At that point I had only been a member of ACCU for a couple of years and I was
becoming friends with a few of the more prominent members. Although said partly
in jest there were some niggling suggestions that I should consider writing
about something. Naturally I downplayed the situation by suggesting that I had
nothing worth saying. After all the stuff I read about in C Vu and Overload was
far cooler than anything I did.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>However during my break the ACCU conference
occurred and I reluctantly agreed to write up a review. This felt like a safe
option, as being a review it was entirely subjective and so I couldn’t really
say anything that might be considered “wrong” per-se. Up to that point the only
thing I’d ever written were some lengthy diatribes to my team mates about the
technical debt in the codebase and how we should probably go about tackling it.
Each email had taken ages to pen and involved constant refactoring to try and
get the tone right. The thought of writing anything longer wasn’t exactly
appealing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I subsequently decided that the safest
route was to self-publish via a blog. This way nothing could be rejected by an
editor and so anything I wrote was definitely going to see the light of day.
Being my own publisher also meant that I had no deadlines. And so after
cranking out a few really safe posts about what I intended to get out of
writing, who the ACCU was, etc. I started to consider tackling something meatier…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It was then that I realised I really didn’t
have anything original to say. As I looked back at my career as an <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Enterprise</st1:City></st1:place> programmer it
occurred to me that I spent my entire career standing on the shoulder of
giants. <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Enterprise</st1:City></st1:place>
development is all about playing it safe. My job involves using mature
technologies to solve the same problems as other enterprises using patterns and
techniques that have already been discovered and documented by others years, if
not decades, ago. If none of what I do is novel is it a surprise that I’d have
nothing truly interesting to write about? After all, if everyone reads the same
books and blogs, follows the same people on Twitter, etc. then they’ll already
know everything I do; probably more. Who exactly would be listening?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Seven months later after playing it safe I
finally started to consider sticking my neck on the line. By then I had thought
about a technique I had used a few years back which I pondered might have some
merit in it. I put together a draft, sent it off to a fellow ACCU member who
had recently asked me to look over a couple of their articles and waited for
the feedback. The feedback was really useful but it seemed I still had quite a
bit of work to do to knock the article into shape.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>That article sat unfinished in my “pending”
folder for over three years! In the meantime I continued to bash out more safe
reviews of the conference, <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">London</st1:City></st1:place>
branch meetings and a few book reviews for some of the less technical tomes. I
was also cajoled into writing a piece for Desert Island Books and Inspirational
Particles, both still firmly in the more subjective writing camp. I know others
find the Code Critique is a good way to get started, but there always seemed to
be so many comprehensive answers that once again I didn’t believe I could add
anything extra.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>So, if you haven’t got anything original to
say, what’s the answer – plagiarise? That’s not really a viable solution. And then
it slowly dawned on me as I started to read more and more of the old classic
books and papers that much of what is said is not necessarily that new anyway,
but what is new is the way it’s presented. As is hopefully apparent from my
article in the previous C Vu about getting to grips with list comprehensions
[1] it took a number of different books, articles, talks and thinking to eventually
understand the concept.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>My first non-review style article finally
appeared almost 4 years after I initially plucked up the courage to even begin writing.
It was about accessing more than 4 GB from a 32-bit Windows process and was
pretty niche given that 64-bit was becoming prevalent even in the slow moving
enterprise world by the time it got published. But I had finally bitten the
bullet and stuck my neck out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I’m a very defensive writer and speaker. I
do not have the courage to suggest what you should or should not do, instead I
prefer to present what I have done, backed up where possible by what my
influences are with the only expectation being that it may be of some value to
someone else. But my fear is that someone will point out what is obvious to
everyone else and negate my entire article or talk by describing how I should be
dong it. It’s not that I’m afraid to be wrong, on the contrary I want to learn,
but I’d feel upset about wasting not only my time, but the time of the
reviewers and readers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>At the conference this year I spoke to a
few people who appear to be under a similar illusion that they have nothing
original to say. For a start they may work in a different industry to me and
have different constraints and cultures which is already interesting. However
they find that despite the plethora of content out on the internet their
colleagues are still unaware of many of the concepts and techniques that those
more experienced take for granted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Maybe the reason many programmers have not
grasped something is not because they are stupid or haven’t bothered reading
about it, but is because nobody has spoken to them in a way that they understand.
I’ve tried to digest the Wikipedia page on monads a number of times but have
found myself lost in a <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">sea</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Computer Science</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
babble. There is much said about Monads which makes me think I probably need to
understand them, but to date no one has spoken to me in a language that I can
comprehend.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>So if you labour under the belief that
everything has already been said and that no regurgitation of existing ideas is
useful then ask yourself this – why did Kevlin Henney begin his talk on
Immutability at this years’ ACCU conference with a modern take on a 20 year old
article written way back in issue 8 of Overload [3]?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They say “those who cannot remember the
past are condemned to repeat it” [4]. Perhaps you can help out those of us
unaware of some aspects of the past by ensuring we don’t waste time
rediscovering it and allowing us to stand on your shoulders as well in the
future.</span></p>
