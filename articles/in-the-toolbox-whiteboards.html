<p class=MsoTitle>In The Toolbox – Whiteboards</p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>They say a picture is worth a thousand words and in software
development there are plenty of words to be said about a great many things from
what we’re building to how we’re building it. The old adage “a stitch in time
saves nine” is a cornerstone of the agile methodology as we struggle to ensure
that the team (customer, developers, testers, etc.) are all on the same page before
we start laying down code.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the modern world of software development where there is a
bias towards “working software over comprehensive documentation” the written word
is starting to give way to higher bandwidth conversations, most notably just
talking to each other face-to-face when the need arises. But words alone are
not enough as not everyone can understand a concept just through verbal
communication, you can’t just talk slower, and louder, and hope that the other
people will just “get it”. The moment a conversation begins to deteriorate is
(if you’ve not already done so) probably a great time to double the lines of
communication and open a channel to the visual senses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In an earlier instalment of this column [1] I touched briefly
on drawing diagrams, but from the perspective of using my notebook as the
canvas. Whilst it has some benefits, for example the permanency, I’ve found
that I would much prefer the larger, more transitory nature of the whiteboard if
it was on offer. What I’ve come to discover is that I was resorting to using my
notebook due to the absence of a better tool (the whiteboard), and because it
was a much better tool than the alternative (Visio &amp; SharePoint) for the
nature of the message I wanted to convey.</p>

<h1>Digital Optimisation</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of downsides of working in The Enterprise is that large
organisations are obsessed with exploiting economies of scale and this is very
noticeable when you look at the workspace allocated to teams. Open plan offices
with banks of desks ensure the maximum density of people and can feel somewhat
like a battery farming approach to software delivery. In a continued drive to
replace anything physical with its virtual equivalent there is no longer any
room for luxuries like whiteboards or Kanban boards. Presumably information
persisted as “electronic bits” are so much more versatile than physical media,
so why would you want to accept anything less?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The rationale for digitising everything in the office is (I
suspect) predicated on a false assumption that doing anything more than once is
waste and must therefore be eliminated. The fact that you have not understood
what it is that needs doing, and will therefore build the wrong thing, is
secondary to the needs of appearing to make progress. By removing the physical
tools we use to collaborate we remove the impetus to do so and the whiteboard
is one of the largest and most accessible reminders we have available. I can
think of no other tool that draws (no pun intended) us in quite like a
whiteboard covered in ad-hoc sketches and notes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Whilst the notion of hot-desking might be great in theory,
in practice a team that is going to spend any considerable amount of time together
needs a place to call home. This spot needs a certain amount of permanence,
ideally closely located to its dependencies, with some surfaces on which the
team can draw and attach its information radiators. If you’re unlucky enough to
be sitting in one of the rat runs that develop when you have a naïve desk
layout then you can use the board as a barrier at one end to dissuade through
traffic. If you have noisy neighbours you might be able to use it as a baffle
too. Just be mindful that any physical barrier you put up radiates information
outwards to ensure you don’t appear sectioned off and hostile towards
collaboration with outsiders.</p>

<h1>Dumb &amp; Smart Boards</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Like most things these days even the humble whiteboard comes
in every form from the simplest to the all-singing, all-dancing, Internet
Enabled <sup>tm</sup> version. Your basic large board on wheels is probably the
most common breed sighted in the wild as it’s easily moveable, and therefore
shareable and large enough to be usable, i.e. hold more than one scribble at a
time. Some offices have re-discovered the benefits of such a medium and gone
all out and turned every wall into a writeable surface. At one company I worked
up you could never find anyone at their desk because they were always at a
break-out room or huddled around some random patch of wall chatting and drawing
pictures.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For those offices that prefer zero-clutter (which usually
means a clean desk policy and nothing on the walls except art or a picture of the
CEO) there is the temporary solution – drive-by whiteboards. These are rolls of
white plastic film which are statically charged and can therefore be hung on
most surfaces, e.g. painted walls and windows. They can stay up for a
surprisingly long time and also easily be taken down and re-hung elsewhere. Rather
than capture their content in another form they are so cheap that you could
just keep the original sketches, at least until you know for sure it’s worth
transcribing them formally elsewhere. Apart from a few surprising surfaces
where they don’t work the main thing to watch out for is ensuring that you
don’t disturb some other team’s peace and tranquillity by pitching up on some
free window space near them for an ad-hoc design meeting. Whilst you might
enjoy attempting to subvert the organisation by getting stuff done, the
complaints from the wrong neighbours may perversely strengthen the argument for
<i>virtual</i> collaboration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the earliest electronic whiteboards I got to use was
essentially a whiteboard with a scanner and printer welded on the side. You
wrote on the board as normal and then when you were done you pushed a button
and the white plastic sheet rotated under the scanner/printer combo like a
giant roll of fax paper to produce your “hard copy”. Since then the humble
board has gotten much smarter, so much so that it’s no longer a physical canvas
but a virtual one. Now you draw fake lines, boxes, circles and arrows with
(coloured) fake pens and create your sketch in the alternate reality. As if
that wasn’t enough your scribble can be added to your SharePoint archive under
the guise of a OneNote document where you can relive this masterpiece time and
time again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Only no one does. In the same way that JIRA brings your
product development into the electronic age with a promise of taking away all
the fuss and nonsense of shuffling around post-it notes, so the electronic
whiteboard comes with similar dreams and aspirations. And yet there is still so
much friction to working with computer-based tooling that it’s easier to just
do it the old fashioned way. Just as the daily stand-up becomes dominated by
the time it takes to access the electronic task board on a shared screen, so a
quick design meeting becomes bogged down in bizarre networking problems and
pens that feel unresponsive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Don’t get me wrong they are very clever pieces of kit and
they can do some pretty neat tricks around transcribing text and recognising
shapes. For example where you might previously have had to rub out and redraw
parts of a diagram on a physical board to make room you can just select an area
and shrink or move it about. If you think your database should have been on the
left, or drawn in red ink just change it. And if you think your sketch is
destined for a greater part in the world then it has tools to clean it up and
allow you to pretend that you drew it in Visio all along.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Of course in the meantime whilst some companies have been
developing smarter boards, others have been developing smarter apps to help
give your physical doodles some permanence. For some, just using the camera
software on your phone will be more than enough, whilst others might want to
clean it up slightly (e.g. fix the white balance) before emailing or uploading
to their team’s Slack channel or wiki. As you might expect there are a number
of free apps for modern phones that are optimised for taking photos of
whiteboards which helps reduce the friction a little more, e.g. Office Lens.
Just bear in mind that it might be quicker to draw it again when the need
arises than shave the yak.</p>

<h1>Notation</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>It’s easy to get hung up on notation, but don’t. Back in the
early ‘90s during The Notation Wars the three amigos (Booch, Jackobson &amp;
Rumbaugh) called a truce and worked together to product the one notation to
rule them all – the Unified Modelling Language (UML). Whilst this caters for a
whole slew of different diagram types each with its own sets of symbols, you’ll
rarely need this in practice to sketch out a concept; in fact most of the time
you can get away with nothing more than some badly drawn squares and a few
arrows.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Being a graphic artist is not a prerequisite for being able
to communicate with simple sketches, yes you might have to redraw bits if they
go really wonky, but that’s the beauty of a whiteboard – rub it off and try
again. If you’re drawing some kind of rough architecture diagram and you want
to be more adventurous you still only really need three symbols: a rectangle, a
tall cylinder (for a database) and a rotated cylinder (for a message queue).
You could even throw in a dotted line if you have a need to distinguish more
than one relationship. The one thing I do think is important is that every
arrow means the same thing – don’t mix-and-match dependencies with data flows
as it’s confusing (the arrows usually just point in opposite directions).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A couple of different coloured pens will naturally allow you
a little more freedom too, such as when you have namespaces and containers to
group things, but as a rule if you find yourself needing lots of different colours
(or trying to add hatching to a diagram) you’ve probably gone over the top. The
main thing to watch out for though is to keep your pens well segregated! When
you’re working with both a whiteboard and post-it notes it’s all too easy for a
permanent marker to infiltrate the whiteboard pen drawer and then you’ve got a
problem. I think it’s worth sticking with well-known brands, e.g. buy Sharpie’s
for your stickies and Staedtler pens for your whiteboard, as you’ll instantly
know if it’s in the wrong pile. Also once whiteboards become popular again make
sure you have a drawer with a seriously heavy-duty lock to keep them and your
board rubber safe from those less well stocked in the stationary department.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As with any technical diagram you should really stick to the
same level of abstraction throughout, e.g. don’t try and mix classes into a high-level
architecture sketch. Simon Brown [2] has a really nice concept that he calls C4
which stands for Context, Container, Component and Class. I’ve found this is a
useful aide memoire when thinking about what it is I want to draw. The static
structure of a system is fairly easy to draw using only rudimentary skills and
basic shapes, but when it comes to something like a sequence diagramming the
swim-lanes approach of UML is as good a notation as any. UML may be much
derided for leading many down the rabbit hole of Big Design Up Front, but the U
in UML (unified) does at least mean that should you choose to embrace a richer
notation it’s one most people should be likely to know.</p>

<h1>Words &amp; Pictures</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although I’ve focused heavily on the more pictorial uses for
whiteboards we shouldn’t forget that they are more useful than that – you can
write words on them too. Okay so they’re not necessarily the best thing for
writing lengthy prose, not least due to the unsightly stain you’ll probably
acquire on the edge of your palm, but there’s nothing wrong with using the
board to help you create lists of stuff. Or you could use the top corner to
write up a point of focus (aka sprint goal) for the next few days to
continuously remind the team about what over-arching business event or theme
they should be collectively working towards.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even though you might be decomposing your work into epics,
stories and tasks, there is still a need to flesh out details at the point of
implementation. For instance you may have defined some loose conditions of
satisfaction [3] at an earlier planning stage, but now that you’re ready to
work on the story in earnest it would be useful to lay down a more formal set
of acceptance criteria, perhaps with the <i>other</i> 3 amigos (BA, developer
and tester). Naturally the board is a good place to work out a list of happy
and sad paths that need to be catered for. Or maybe you need to sketch out
something around the UI, perhaps the developer and tester need to factor some
kind of test API into the design, or someone from ops needs to see how this new
feature affects the monitoring of the system. A story is just a placeholder for
this conversation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Whilst index cards are nice for arranging on a desk, they
don’t stick very well to walls, unlike Post-it notes. I’ve known places though where
you aren’t allowed to stick Post-it notes on windows and their walls are
painted with some kind of anti-sticky-note paint, so the board may have to
double up as both a task board and design tool. Personally I’ve always been
fonder of arranging things on a vertical surface than horizontal, but I’m sure
mileage varies greatly here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The one thing I never use the board for is writing code.
Apart from an interview where I’m being specifically asked to write code on a
board, I’d always do it at a terminal using a tool custom built for the job –
the text editor.</p>

<h1>Write On / Wipe Off</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>The humble whiteboard is becoming an endangered species in
the corporate world. It’s a sad moment seeing one sat in the corner of an
office with an architecture diagram from years ago almost burnt into it because
the pen ink has had so long to dry out. Almost every day for a board should be
different as people come and go, stopping only briefly to chat, sketch, write,
arrange, sip coffee and reflect before moving on. These bursts of activity will
be interspersed with periods of serenity, before once again the slate is swiped
clean and the hullabaloo of collaboration punctuates the air once again. Whiteboards
are for living.</p>
