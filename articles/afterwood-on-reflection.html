<p class=MsoNormal>Way back in 2014 I gave a slightly extended lightning talk
at the ACCU Conference titled <i>The Art of Code</i> [1]. One of the “humorous”
code snippets I presented lampooned the hidden complexity that can arise from
the overuse of reflection based libraries and frameworks, most notably of the
dependency injection kind. At the time I had found myself face-to-face with a
C# codebase that was difficult to reason about due to this very affliction and
it also lead me to make the following pun on Twitter:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“They say C# &amp; Java developers have a habit of overusing
reflection. Given the quality of their code I'd say they're not reflecting
enough...”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The vast majority of my Twitter puns are poor attempts at
wordplay and throwaway comments but every once in a while I realise there may
be something deeper in the punchline that I wasn’t immediately aware of. Consequently
I now find myself reflecting on reflection which feels awfully meta!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While I never realised it until very recently I believe my
own interest in reflection is another one of those characteristics which I can
attribute to Steve Maguire’s 1993 book <i>Writing Solid Code</i>. One of the
ideas he introduces quite early on is the notion that when you find a bug,
before fixing it, you ask yourself some questions, such as “how could I have
prevented this” and “how could I have automatically detected it”. The book goes
on to introduce the use of ASSERTs to verify assumptions along with cranking up
optional compiler diagnostics and using static analysers to work smarter instead
of harder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Initially I limited this practice to what the book was
addressing – writing code – but as my experience as a programmer grew and I got
to branch out into other disciplines I found myself adopting the question more
and more whenever something went awry. Around the same time Ed Nisley’s column
in Dr Dobbs Journal began to explore some of the post mortems that NASA had
been publishing and while I took solace in even their ability to fail
spectacularly on occasion with the vast resources they had available, their
desire to reflect and improve at every scale was an attitude I felt was laudable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Consequently that question grew from being a way to help
avoid bugs in native code to being one that pervaded more and more aspects of
both my professional and personal life. It wasn’t just limited to trying to
help avoid my own mistakes either but became a more natural question to ask
whenever something went wrong. I found I started developing a strong desire to
avoid settling for simply fixing incidents in isolation and instead to see if
there might be an underlying pattern and therefore find a way to avoid the
entire <i>class</i> of incidents in future.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After many late nights in those early days debugging native
code I was perfectly happy to buy into Maguire’s advice around leveraging
tooling and practices that would minimise these problems. It didn’t take me
long to be sold on unit testing and then Test Driven Development (TDD) either
once I eventually became aware of them and my own inadequacies at manual testing.
(Interestingly Maguire only makes a passing comment about unit tests – <i>if
you have them</i>, you should run them. I now wonder what unit tests looked
like back in the early ‘90s!)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a metaphorical sense you might consider a test-first
mentality to be the “reflection” in a timeline from a post-debugging
retrospective – a desire to unearth defects as early as possible is a natural
consequence of frustration after being by bitten by a problem that could have
easily been avoided. Even if the problem was unavoidable, being in a position
to automatically validate and deploy the resulting fix quickly is still a much
better place to be than facing another phase of handovers and manual testing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That level of pessimism which comes with hard won experience
was once summed up wonderfully by @fioroco on Twitter back in 2017 [2]:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>junior dev: &quot;i found the bug&quot;<br>
senior dev: &quot;i found a bug&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Naturally there is a balance here. Sometimes it is just a
simple mistake but other times it’s a more fundamental misunderstanding. I once
discovered a memory leak caused by a non-virtual destructor in a base class.
Rather than fix it and move on I checked for a pattern and quickly found the
same author had done it another 19 times and, although not in my team any more,
were still only a few desks away. They really appreciated the heads up and I
managed to stem the tide in two systems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the interviewing front I’ve begun to feel that a tendency
to reflect on one’s work is probably a strong indicator of quality, even if
they haven’t performed it as a formal exercise like a retrospective. I’ve never
really been one to ask classic interview questions like “What does SOLID stand
for” but I want candidates to try and embellish more on the “why” when talking
about what they’ve worked on – I like decisions to be conscious rather than
done by rote. Hence if a candidate lists something like SOLID on their CV I’d
ask them “give me an example when you applied one of the SOLID principles as
part of a refactoring”. I’ve found this style of question provides more avenues
to explore their thought processes and understanding of a topic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even if behaviours are automatic now, maybe they were once
done more consciously and it’s been a while since any reflection was performed on
the practice or the conditions under which they once applied. It’s taken a
beating over the last few years due to misuse in some circles but the principle
of “strong opinions weakly held” is one I still feel is valuable. The school of
hard knocks can send us down a more cautious path which often bears fruit for a
considerable time, but we should be open to being challenged and accept that
progress may have been made in the intervening years. I now find that usually
comes from others, but not necessarily as direct criticism, more as a fleeting
comment which I once might have simply dismissed but now embrace as an
opportunity to re-evaluate past decisions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Maguire’s book also taught me to step through new code with
a debugger, a practice which I found invaluable for so many years. Even after
adopting unit testing and then TDD I struggled to let go of the debugger even
when writing tests. But what caused me to drop it in the end wasn’t more
confidence in my ability to solve problems correctly first time but that the
massively reduced cost of failure and recovery in modern software development meant
I could be far less paranoid of the consequences.</p>

<h3>Biography</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chris is a freelance programmer who started out as a bedroom
coder in the 80’s writing assembler on 8-bit micros. These days it's enterprise
grade technology <s>in plush corporate offices</s> from the comfort of his
breakfast bar. He has resumed commentating on the Godmanchester duck race but
continues to be easily distracted by messages to gort@cix.co.uk and
@chrisoldwood.</p>
