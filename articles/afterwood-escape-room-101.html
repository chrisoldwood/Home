</div>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>As I write this the number one show on the
popular streaming service Netflix is called Squid Game, a South Korean drama
where hundreds of adult contestants compete in a deadly series of children’s
games for a life changing sum of money. Naturally the meme generators are
working overtime and I can’t help but be seduced by thoughts of how you might
apply the premise of the show to our own profession. The show has a somewhat
macabre element which I’d rather not dwell on in a family friendly publication
such as this, so maybe The Crystal Maze would be considered a better format. However,
if it’s children’s games from <i>my</i> era we’re after then I’d need to
regress a few more years back into the mid ‘80s BBC Archives where we meet its
spiritual successor – The Adventure Game. This show was set on the fictional
planet of Arg which feels like the perfect place for programmers to battle it
out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>This also feels like the ideal topic to
start testing our contestant’s mettle – passing arguments. The scenario I have
in mind is one which I personally have spent the past few weeks tearing my hair
out over, namely passing arguments with embedded quotes. Shells like Bash and
PowerShell support more than one style of quotes (for string interpolation
reasons) which makes the simple case undaunting. The show should require
something more akin to my recent task which involved passing a non-trivial
PowerShell command line to a remote Windows VM from a Bash shell, which in turn
invoked a shell script that used SSH to talk to the VM’s host and SSH from the
host into the guest VM, which in turn had Bash configured as the default shell
on the Windows side. That should keep them busy for a while just googling how
to escape quote characters in different shells and tools!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The second game I have in mind taps into
the Squid Game theme, but only in name – Stuck in the Mud. On this occasion
we’re not alluding to the Multi-User Dungeon, which is probably more befitting
of the Adventure Game, but the term popularised by Brian Foote and Joseph
Yoder. As a system grows over time close attention must be paid to the
architecture and design lest it wind up as the aforementioned Big Ball of Mud –
a sprawling mess of spaghetti code. Hence the task our competitors must face
would be to make sense of a legacy codebase and refactor it so the unnecessary
duplication is removed and it becomes more amenable to change without taking
its toll on the team’s morale.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Much as I like the play on words in that
title, I think there is a better playground game that lends itself moreto this
particular exercise. In “Spot” players take it in turns to kick a football
against a wall, and if they miss, they lose a life. (Each life is represented
by one letter of S.P.O.T. and when all lives are lost the player is out). Not only
does the title gel nicely with the idea of refactoring to reduce the
duplication of concepts, i.e. a Single Point of Truth (aka SPOT), but the
format also suggests the use of limiting the number of test failures allowed as
a mechanism for “lives”. I’m sure it won’t be lost on the contestants the
ridiculousness of a scenario where the production code is in an absolute mess
but it also contains a full suite of tests. I’m going to have my work cut out
for me trying to provide a plausible backstory. (As an aside I’m now beginning
to wonder if Kent Beck took his inspiration for “Test &amp;&amp; Commit ||
Revert” from the show as that also seems quite brutal…)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Given the amount of exposure the tv show
has had in the media and on the socials in the last few weeks I don’t think
it’s a spoiler to say that one of the challenges they face in Squid Game is a
variation of what we Brits called Statues, but they call Red Light/Green Light,
where the players have to creep up on the person who’s “it” while their back is
turned. I sense there is some additional testing related mileage here under the
more “punful” name Red Bar/Green Bar. Here you can’t make progress by adding
new features to the product unless the bar is green; when it’s red you must fix
the code first. That feels a little too much like real life but in my game you
won’t be able to just comment the test out, add an ignore attribute, or make
the test run multiple times in the hope it succeeds eventually and manages to
hide the lack of determinism. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>For the finale I can think of no more
difficult a topic for programmers to tackle than that of time. In “What’s the
Time Mr. Wolf?” our contestants will be faced with a series of challenges that
require them to correctly calculate dates and times across the globe. For example,
one task might be to use Outlook in one country to book a Zoom meeting where
all the participants are situated in other countries. You lose a life if at
least one person doesn’t show up at the correct time. Another would see you
execute a multi-currency, multi-month trade where the start and end dates straddle
Christmas and Golden Week, during a leap year. I mustn’t forget to include a daylight
saving time puzzle in there somewhere too!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I’m sure if I cast my mind back far enough
to my childhood, I can dredge up some more inspiration. The game of Sardines (a
variant of Hide-and-Seek) where you work ever harder to overcome a lack of
capacity has an eerily familiar tone to it. Likewise the practice of chaos
engineering feels like it has its roots in a game of Knock Down Ginger where
you try and switch off random hardware without getting caught by the customer,
and I’ve definitely been involved in code reviews that have felt more a game of
British Bulldog!</span></p>
