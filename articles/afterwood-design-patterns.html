<p class=MsoTitle><span lang=EN-US>Afterwood</span></p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>There is a perennial question which crops
up fairly regularly on Twitter and other social media platforms that questions
the value of design patterns. The more clickbait styled tweets will simply
declare that design patterns and the similarly titled Gang of Four (GoF) book
in particular have little relevance in today’s programming toolbox and
therefore you should simply ignore them as an anachronism. The more curious
programmer on the other hand hopefully seeks a little more substance but may still
struggle to see past a movement which has seen better days and provides little
interest in these modern times.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>And who can blame them? If you’re a
fresh-faced programmer devouring everything the industry has to offer and you
come across a book from 1994 with C++ code where the examples pass raw pointers
around wouldn’t you be somewhat concerned? While perhaps not quite as
dangerous, but still firmly in the realm of “who on Earth still uses that?”
territory, you also have a bunch of UML class and sequence diagrams to contend
with. (Guess what, UML isn’t dead either, but that’s a topic for another day.)
And the final nail in the coffin must surely be the fact that a number of the
documented patterns in the seminal GoF book pretty much evaporate the moment you
consider that C++ has supported lambda functions for almost a decade. Functors
are so last Millennium and the double-checked lock finally works by design – no
longer relying on compiler extensions – should you still be inclined to litter
your codebase with a Singleton (once a very popular choice but now public enemy
#1 for the test driven programmer).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Even Java, which didn’t exist at the time
the book was written, but was still hugely popular during the rise of the
Design Patterns movement has since sprouted lambda functions and eased the
burden of solving some of those recurring problems the book helped to address.
And while we’re on the subject of Java some of the blame for people having an
aversion to design patterns must lie squarely with that unfortunate practice of
naming classes by chaining together the names of any design patterns the class
relates to, as if there is some kind of prize for winning “Design Pattern
Bingo”. I have personally been the recipient of code from a company’s
Enterprise Architect that contained the monstrosity:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Courier New"'>public
class UnitOfWorkXxxServiceFacadeDecorator</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>(In this particular instance the entire
class hierarchy was replaced by a couple of succinctly named C# extension
methods that wrapped a caller-provided closure with the necessary behaviour.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>So, are they right then? Are design
patterns a waste of time – a solution to a problem in a context where that
context was the early ‘90s and the problem was simply poorly designed
programming languages?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>No, I don’t think so. The Gang of Four
legacy is not some old-fashioned C++ code and a bunch of UML diagrams with
large class hierarchies; it’s the <i>ubiquitous language</i> they created. The
value was never in how they realized the solution in code but in the <i>vocabulary</i>
they chose for describing the recurring problem they identified and the “shape”
of the solution they came up with. By distilling the essence into just a single
word (in almost all cases), and at most three words (for one), they have given
us the power to communicate complex ideas in mere seconds. Can you imagine how
much longer your design meetings would be if you had to keep saying “a
one-to-many relationship between objects so that when one object changes all
its dependents are notified and updated automatically” instead of simply saying
“observer”?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Even if some design patterns use terms that
already had a fairly established meaning in the software industry, such as
Proxy (GoF), Cache (POSA3), and Pool (POSA3), the community has taken those
ideas and given them a more <i>usable</i> definition. Instead of leaving them
to remain ambiguous they have given them clarity. As Dijkstra once said:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“The purpose of abstraction is not to be
vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely
precise.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Each pattern does not exist in a vacuum,
but together with other related patterns from the same vocabulary they form a <i>language</i>
in their own right that allows people to explore design options in a particular
problem space without getting dragged into the implementation minutiae too
quickly. Once the foundation patterns in the original GoF text and its ilk,
such as the first volume of the Pattern Oriented Software Architecture (POSA)
series, had arrived further catalogues appeared that focused on particular
topics such as resource management, concurrency, integration, etc. Both the
POSA and Pattern Languages of Program Design (PLoPD) series stretched to 5
volumes, with the annual PLoP conference still taking place today despite
starting way back in 1994. To paraphrase Mark Twain: any rumours of the demise
of the patterns community are greatly exaggerated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>For those happy to contend there is still
value in the concept of design patterns, is there still any point delving into
the distant past – given what was said earlier about some original patterns now
being redundant, does the GoF book still hold any relevance? Absolutely!
Section 1.6 alone contains a useful summary of many of the core ideas behind
object-orientation including what is probably one of <i>the</i> most
significant programming axioms – program to an interface, not an
implementation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>However it’s largely a catalogue of
patterns and many of those are still relevant to today’s design discussions
because the vocabulary is still with us today. The aforementioned “observer”
might have matured over the years and more closely resembles its sibling –
Multicast, introduced in the follow-up book Pattern Hatching – but it’s still
there at the heart of any event driven system. The terms Adapter, Facade,
Factory, and Proxy had a life before the GoF and naturally continue to live on
albeit with a more refined definition. Iterators are a fundamental part of C++,
Java, and C# and Decorators became a key idiom in Python. Decorators in Python
are considered to be far less rigid than the GoF definition, more akin to
Aspect Oriented Programming, but that might be because the AOP term appears to
post-date the Decorator pattern. Either way, there are big similarities in the
metaphor, and that aids communication. The one pattern that seems to have
gained popularity over the years, no doubt due to the rise of automated testing
is Builder. The need to create non-trivial object graphs in tests where the
salient details of the test data need to remain clear has led to the adoption
of Builder (coupled with fluent interfaces) as a very popular technique.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The Conclusion to the <i>Design Patterns</i>
book starts by saying “It’s possible to argue this book hasn’t accomplished
much.” I think it’s fair to say that 25 years later you would be hard pushed to
agree with this statement. While the example code is dated and the ubiquity of
closures in modern programming languages have consigned some of the solutions
to the history books the vocabulary appears to be timeless. Their concise
vocabulary and the subsequent lexicon it spawned are the real legacy of the
Gang of Four and I for one thank them for helping me spend less time in
meetings and having more productive design conversations.</span></p>
