<p class=MsoNormal>As the pendulum swings ever closer towards being leaner, and
focusing on simplicity, I grow more concerned about how this is beginning to
affect software architecture. By breaking our work down into ever smaller
chunks and then focusing on delivering the next most valuable thing, how much
of what is further down the pipeline is being factored into the design
decisions we make today? And consequently, how much pain are we storing up for
ourselves because we took the pejorative Big Design Up Front (BDUF) too far and
ended up with No Design Up Front?</p>

<h2>Wasteful Thinking</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Part of the ideas around being leaner is an attempt to
reduce waste caused by speculative requirements which has led many a project in
the past into a state of “analysis paralysis” where they can’t decide what to
build because the goalposts keep moving or the problem is so underspecified
there are simply too many options and we have to second-guess everything. By
focusing on delivering something simpler, much sooner, we begin to receive an
initial return on our investment earlier which helps shape the future design based
on <i>practical</i> feedback from today, rather than guessing what we need.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When we’re building those simpler features that sit nicely
upon our existing foundations we have much less need to worry about the cost of
rework from getting it wrong as it’s unlikely to be overly expensive. But as we
move from independent features to those which are based around, say, a new
“concept” or “pillar” we should not be afraid to spend a little more time
looking further down the product backlog to see how any design choices we are
considering now, <i>might</i> play out later. Emergent Design is not a Random
Walk but a set of educated guesses based on what we currently know, and strongly
suspect about the near future.</p>

<h2>Thinking to Excess?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The term “overthinking” implies that we are doing <i>more</i>
thinking than is actually necessary; trying to fit everyone’s requirements in
and getting bogged down in analysis is definitely an undesirable outcome of
spending too much time thinking about a problem. As a consequence, we are
starting to think less and less up-front about the problems we solve to try and
ensure that we only solve the problems we actually have and not the problems we
think we’ll have in the future. Solving problems that we are only speculating
about <i>can</i> lead to overengineering if they never manage to materialise or
could have been solved more simply when the facts are eventually known.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But how much thinking is overthinking? If I have a feature
to develop and only spend as much effort thinking as I need to solve that
problem today then, by definition, any more thinking than that is “overthinking
it”. But not thinking about the wider picture is exactly what leads to the
kinds of architecture &amp; design problems that begin to hamper us later in
the product’s lifetime, and later on might not be measured in years but could
be weeks or even days if we are looking to build a set of related features that
all sit on top of a new concept or pillar. Building the simplest thing that
could possibly work does not mean being naïve about the future.</p>

<h2>The Thinking Horizon</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hence, it feels to me that some amount of overthinking is
necessary to ensure that we don’t prematurely pessimise our solution and paint
ourselves into a corner too quickly. As such, we should factor in related work
further down the backlog, at least into our thoughts, to help us see the bigger
picture and work out how we can shape our decisions today to ensure it biases
our thinking towards our anticipated future rather than an arbitrary one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Acting on our impulses prematurely can lead to
overengineering if we implement what’s in our thoughts without having a fairly
solid backlog to draw on, and overengineering is wasteful. In contrast a small
amount of overthinking – thought experiments – are relatively cheap and can go
towards helping to maintain the integrity of the system’s architecture by
narrowing the solution space to something more realistic. Very few software
products have the need to scale to anything like what you read about in the technology
news pages, despite what the optimists in the business might have you planning
for.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The phrase “think globally, act locally” is usually reserved
for talking about the health of the planet, but I think it is fractal in
nature, in that you can also apply it at the software system level too, to
suggest factoring in thinking about the design &amp; architecture of the system
even though you are only implementing a feature in a small part of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One has to be careful quoting old adages like “a stitch in
time saves nine” or “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure” because
they can send the wrong message and lead us back to where we were before –
stuck for eternity in The Analysis Phase. That said, I also want us to avoid
“throwing the baby out with the bathwater” and end up forgetting exactly how
much thinking is required to achieve sustained delivery in the longer term.</p>
