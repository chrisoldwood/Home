<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><u><span lang=EN-GB>Ed
Sykes – Mocking in C++<o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Once again we returned to the location
where I first experienced an ACCU London talk – the offices of 7 City at
Moorgate. The July meet-up saw us listening to Ed Sykes talk about Mocking in
C++. As usual there was a good turnout with a few new faces to try and recruit
in the bar opposite afterwards.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Ed started with a straw poll or two to try
and gauge the audience and for once I fell into the minority as most of them
were actively doing C++ and doing some form of modern unit testing. This
allowed him to cut to the chase and get on with looking into the two mocking
frameworks that he was using in his current position – MockItNow and Hippo Mocks.
He acknowledged later that other frameworks had matured in the meantime, but
that these two were the ones his team had focused on at the time they had started
investigating the use of a 3<sup>rd</sup> party mocking framework for use with their
C++ code-base.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>First up was MockItNow which he clearly saw
as a solution most suitable for those targeting the Microsoft compiler and
trying to use mocking with a legacy code-base. C++ programmers have a natural
tendency to want to look under the hood and fortunately he answered the obvious
nagging question many of us immediately had, which was “How does it work”? Once
this minor distraction was resolved we could get on with just enjoying how the
tests were expressed and what features it provided. His examples were simple
enough to touch on the salient points, yet still managed to show it in action
by actually running a set of tests with VS2010.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The second offering Ed explored was Hippo Mocks,
which is a newer and more actively developed framework. Whereas MockItNow
provides good support for legacy code-bases where concrete classes may be the
norm, Hippo Mocks targets a more modern style of C++ code where the use of
Interfaces are more prevalent to separate concerns. The same examples were
carried over from the previous discussion to provide continuity, but with some
minor changes required to allow the mocked type to be passed via the
constructor. Whereas the MockItNow examples had a dash of macro magic the Hippo
Mocks ones seemed a little more conventional.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It’s a brave presenter that does live
coding during a talk but Ed rose to the challenge to try and answer some of the
questions from the audience by adapting his existing tests. Hippo Mocks showed
its header-only, template-based nature nicely by spewing some unpleasant
compiler errors as Ed tried to rework the tests but the speculative questions
were never really going to be answered easily with the small amount of time
left. Still, we did get to look inside this implementation too and Ed explained
that his team had extended it relatively easily.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Those who have worked in other modern, reflection-capable
languages like C# and Java will have been spoilt for years with mature mocking
frameworks. Ed confidently showed us that C++ is finally catching up, even if
some of the tools are platform specific or not quite as flexible as those
available for its curly-brace cousins.</span></p>
