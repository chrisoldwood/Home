<p class=MsoTitle><span lang=X-NONE>Afterwood - Sweep the Floor</span></p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>It’s interesting to watch other professions at work. Unless
you work on the ground floor of a glass building or sit on a train with a
monster-sized laptop it’s highly unlikely that Joe Public is ever going to be
able to watch you writing software without being highly intrusive. Even if
someone is visiting the office much of what happens is on a screen that is too
small and inappropriately angled to see what’s really going on; an impromptu
huddle or conversation around a whiteboard is about the only glimpse they might
get of us in action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sitting in the queue at the hairdressers – a traditionally
open-plan workspace – you can watch the staff at work. While plenty of time is
spent working directly with each client to make their hair look special there
are other activities which take place before, during and after which are not
directly related to styling the client’s hair, but nevertheless still contribute
to the experience for both the client and stylist. For example it’s quite
common for a member of staff to be wandering around with a broom constantly
sweeping the floor. This task is not solely performed by some intern or
graduate who’s beginning to learn the ropes but may be done by senior staff too
if the need arises rather than let the pile of discarded hair accumulate.
Similarly their core tools and products are readily accessible, you rarely see
a hairdresser wandering around trying to find a pair of scissors or some
styling wax.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I find the same can be true of building sites, whether it be
large scale construction or a new extension to the house. Decent builders will
constantly sweep up and clean around themselves whilst they are working, not
just at the end of the day before knocking off. Likewise people working in a
kitchen can be seen wiping the sides, returning products to the store and
washing up crockery and utensils.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While there is undoubtedly an element of “health &amp;
safety” in all these professions that acts as a strong driver to try and keep
the workspace clean and tidy, that can’t be the only reason. The open plan
nature of many hairdressing salons no doubt acts as another driver for them to
keep the place presentable as the window is literally a shop window showing
passers-by what’s on offer. Open kitchens are “a thing” too so that customers
can sit and watch the chefs at work and be part of the entire cooking experience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I find it hard to believe anybody truly enjoys working in a
pig sty, except maybe some pig farmers, and yet those of us who work in offices
(of the virtual kind where our “files” and “folders” exist merely as electrical
phenomena and our “desktop” is just a visual metaphor) often seem oblivious to
the virtual detritus surrounding us. Unless you’re working in an industry where
lives are at stake there is no risk to anyone’s health from leaving around
commented out code, ignored tests, unused source files, stale 3<sup>rd</sup>
party packages, old build configurations, redundant source repositories, out of
date documentation, uncommitted deployment hacks, build warnings, temporary log
messages, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While there are essentially no health risks, undue stress
notwithstanding, there is surely an effect on productivity as people keep
discovering the same remnants of days gone past and then wasting time on
questioning what they’re failing to comprehend until somebody fills in the
blanks. It takes time before the muscle memory kicks in so that the same
discovery again and again can quickly be discarded. Even if we deal with the
problem the first time we encounter it we are unlikely to have all the same
context the original “perpetrator” had and therefore it will take us longer to
correct than simply doing it properly first time around.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While commented out code is trivial to deal with, dead code
is often much harder to isolate even with modern refactoring tools unless it
literally has no call sites and is not an obvious target for invocation by
reflection either. Writing unit tests is great for live code but it hides dead
code from our tools. Even when you don’t have any tests keeping it alive, finding
the roots and checking if <i>they’re</i> still live can require a fair bit of
legwork.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ancillary code such as the tools and scripts used to stitch
together build, test, deployment and support processes can often accumulate a
large amount of cruft over time as their “non-production” status frequently grants
them only 3<sup>rd</sup> class citizenship. Their very nature can be highly
environment specific too meaning that any change is going to be tricky to test
and therefore <i>proving</i> redundancy could be non-trivial.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not all changes start with a clear entry path that leads to
an obvious test plan either. Often we find something that needs changing and
then go looking sideways to find similar points of interest, such as the same type
of mistake made elsewhere or where the same code could have been copy-pasted
rather than factored out. Once we find them, unless we are going to simply “hit
and hope”, we have to navigate back out again to work out how we’re going to
test those changes too. Choosing not to join up the dots and blindly changing
redundant code or configuration only adds to the appearance of liveliness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Remember when you were a student or first shared a house
with other people you didn’t really know? Don’t be <i>that</i> person who puts
empty cereal boxes back in the cupboard, leaves a useless amount of milk in the
carton and only washes up their own dishes. Please, for the sake of your <s>flat</s>
teammates, clean the sides and sweep the floor.</p>
