<p class=MsoNormal>The most famous quote about optimisation, at least in
programming circles, is almost certainly “premature optimisation is the root of
all evil”. When I was growing up this was attributable to Donald Knuth, but he
fessed up saying that he was just quoting Sir Tony Hoare, although Sir Tony
seemed reluctant to claim ownership. According to the fount of all knowledge,
Wikipedia, things appear to have been straightened out now and Sir Tony has
graciously accepted attribution. That quote was originally about the
performance of code and should ideally be presented in its greater detail so as
not to lose the context in which it was said. The surrounding lines “We should
forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: […]. Yet we should
not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.” remind us that there is a
time and a place for optimisation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Of course we’re all agile these days and do not pamper to
speculative requirements – we only consider performance when there is a clear business
need to. Poppycock! Herb Sutter and Andrei Alexandrescu certainly didn’t
believe such nonsense and popularised the antonym “pessimization” in the
process. Item 9 in their excellent book <i>C++ Coding Standards: 101 Rules,
Guidelines, and Best Practices</i> tells us not to prematurely pessimize either;
i.e. we shouldn’t go out of our way to avoid appearing to prematurely optimise
by simply writing stupid code – choosing a sensible design or algorithm is not
premature optimisation. For most of us the sorting algorithm was a problem
solved years ago and the out-of-the box Quicksort variation (something else attributable
to Sir Tony Hoare) that we get in our language runtime is almost certainly an excellent
starting point. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another favourite quote on the subject of optimisation comes
from Rob Pike where he tells us “fancy algorithms are slow when N is small, and
N is usually small”.  While there are many new products which aim to scale to
the heady heights of Twitter and Facebook, most are destined for a user base
many orders of magnitude lower than them. Whilst it’s all very interesting to
read up on how a company like Facebook has to design its own hardware to deal
with its scaling issues, that’s definitely something for the back pocket in
case you really do end up on The Next Big Thing rather than an architectural
stance which you should adopt by default.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On Twitter John Carmack once extrapolated from Sir Tony and
observed that performance is not the only thing which we can be accused of
prematurely optimising: “you can prematurely optimize maintainability,
flexibility, security, and robustness [too]”.  Although I didn’t realise it at
first I eventually discovered that my own C++ unit testing framework, which I
thought I was being super clever with by eliding all those really difficult
bits, like naming, was actually a big mistake. By focusing so heavily on the
short term goals I had written a framework that was optimised for writing tests,
but not reading them. As such, many of my earliest unit tests were shockingly
incoherent mere days later and not worth the (virtual) paper they were written
on. Every time I revisited them I probably spent orders of magnitude more time
trying to understand them than what it would have taken in the first place to slow
down and write them more lucidly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Outside the codebase, the development process is another
area where it’s all too easy to end up optimising for the wrong audience. The
primary measure of progress should be working software, and yet far too much
effort can be put into finding proxies for this metric. Teams that choose
internally to track their work using tools and metrics to help them improve
their rate of delivery is laudable, whereas imposing complex work tracking
processes on a team to make it easier to measure progress from afar is
unproductive. For example The Gemba Walk – the practice of management directly
observing the work – allows those doing the work to dedicate more of their time
to generating value rather than finding arbitrary ways to represent their
progress.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tooling is a common area where a rift between those who do
and those who manage arises. For example it’s not uncommon to find effort
duplicated between the source code or version control system and the work
tracking tool because the management wants it in a form they can easily
consume, even if that comes at the expense of more developer time. For example
I’ve seen code diffs and commit comments pasted into change request Word
documents for review, and acceptance criteria in Gherkin synchronised between
JIRA stories and test code because those in control get to call the shots on
the format  of any handover so they can minimise their own workload.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Engineering is all about trade-offs, both within the product
itself and the process used to deliver it. As software engineers we might find
it easier to trade off the dimensions of time and space in the guise of CPU
cycles and memory and find it harder to weigh-up, or more likely, control,
trading off time between our present and future selves. The increasing
recognition of metaphors like Technical Debt and management styles such as
Servant Leadership will continue to help raise the profile of some of the more
common sources of tension but we still need to be on the lookout for those
moments where our apparent cleverness may really be a rod for our own backs.</p>
