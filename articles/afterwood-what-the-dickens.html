<p class=MsoTitle>Afterwood - What the Dickens?!</p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Quality was dead: to begin with.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Okay, that’s not the real opening to Charles Dicken’s
popular yuletide novella A Christmas Carol, set in 19<sup>th</sup> century
England long before the appearance of software development as an industry, but
Marley’s warning can easily be seen as an allegory for technical debt. Despite
what George Box once said about all metaphors being wrong, but some being
useful – see what I did there – I reckon we can look to Marley for inspiration
about how we should treat our code, and the ramifications of not giving it
enough TLC. Marley confesses that he now wears the chain he forged in life,
made link-by-link, and yard-by-yard of his own free will. He could equally be
talking about not bothering to refactor, with every link being a missed
opportunity to rename a variable or function, extract logic to a separate
method, write an automated test, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Back in 2008 Thom Holwerda proposed that the only real
measurement of code quality was WTFs per minute. The fallout from Marley’s
decision to continually cut corners emerges verbally, later, as his successor
tries to make sense of that code. This being a family friendly publication though
I can’t spell out WTF in full and propose instead that just for the festive
season we switch to the far more old-fashioned form of WTDs (What the Dickens!)
per minute.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I should note though that the “Dickens” in that expression
of surprise is entirely unrelated to the author in question, having been used
by Shakespeare a few hundred years before Charles was even born. The etymology
suggests it’s a euphemism for the Devil, also known as Old Nick – not to be
confused with the more lovable Saint Nick, who also enters our consciousness
this time of year. It’s an easy mistake to make, especially when you consider
that Satan and Santa are anagrams of each other. Marley was also trying to tell
us that naming <i>is</i> hard, and typos can lead to a lot of confusion if left
unchecked. (I once ran across a variable named “NoErrors” where “no” was
actually an abbreviation of “number”, in a programming language that allowed an
implicit conversion from an integer to boolean – convince me that’s not the
Devil at work.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Oldwood household the favoured adaption is A Muppet
Christmas Carol, with Albert Finney’s Scrooge coming in a close second, at
least for the parents. Jim Henson’s decision to cast both Statler <i>and</i>
Waldorf as the Marley brothers was genius. Their modus operandi is to sit on
the sidelines and make snarky comments about the various goings-on, but never
actually make any sensible suggestions on how to genuinely improve the state of
affairs. If you’ve never had to work with a Statler or a Waldorf, then I envy
you. Code reviews often feel like an interview with those grumpy old men as
I’ve found it quite rare for people to point out the positive aspects of a code
change and only focus on the bits we disagree with. We should all strive to “be
more Kermit”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Despite being one of the more faithful adaptions, A Muppet
Christmas Carol glosses over the same time paradox as many others. In the book,
Scrooge is told that he will be visited on three consecutive nights, and yet
the tale starts on Christmas Eve but he still wakes up on Christmas Day after
the three visits, exclaiming “The Spirits have done it all in one night!”
Clearly this is a classic case of management not liking the estimate that
Marley proposed. Knowing how poor the codebase had become Marley estimates
three days but somebody upstairs decides Christmas Day is a hard deadline and
the ghosts need to work overtime and get redemption delivered in one night.
Releasing on Christmas Day is fraught with danger unless you’re part of a
well-oiled machine, mostly because pretty much everyone else apart from the
skeleton support crew will be on holiday.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What of the three ghosts though? Even though our industry is
still in its infancy in comparison to many others, we still have plenty to
reflect on. Also, the ghosts are with us permanently now in the guise of blog
posts, journals, books, videos, talks, etc. We only have to remember to learn
from the past to avoid repeating it. How hard can that be?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I write, the legendary Fred Brooks passed away <i>exactly</i>
two years ago to the day. (This also gives you an insight into my inability to
meet publishing deadlines and turns the irony level of writing about learning
from the past right up to eleven and beyond.)  Of his most famous works the “no
silver bullet” statement – about there being no single development in
technology or management that can provide <i>even</i> an order of magnitude
improvement to productivity within a decade – is probably the one which many would
love to prove wrong.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There have definitely been some excellent advances over the
years, like the introduction of structured programming and the continued efforts
to avoid so many of the traps and pitfalls of our forefathers. Incremental
software delivery, the one technique which Brooks conceded in the mid-90s might
come close, has also paid dividends and helped us to focus more on the essential
complexity. Likewise automated testing and refactoring help us tackle the
accidental complexity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My current fear is the Ghost of Christmas Future showing us
a world where we have put all our efforts into AGI in the mistaken belief that
writing code is the hard part of software development and we end up repeating
the foolish promises of 4GLs and UML. In this picture, Tiny Tim – the sick
child of Scrooge’s bookkeeper Bob Cratchit – is not just a single codebase or
company but the entire software industry as we fail to comprehend what
“describing a solution in unambiguous detail” <i>really</i> means.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hopefully this charade will be exposed for the pantomime
that it currently is and those working on LLM based tools which provide valuable,
direct assistance to Bob Cratchits at every level of their career can get on
with improving their tools, undistracted by the Scrooge’s of this world who see
many programmers as “the surplus population” that just want to “pick their
pocket every <s>December 25<sup>th</sup></s> day”. Seriously, what the actual
Dickens!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blimey, that took a bleak turn, I reckon my text editor must
have enabled dark mode. It’s Christmas, a time for festive cheer, and we should
remember that the book ends on a high note with Scrooge achieving redemption
and Dickens revealing that “Tiny Tim, who did not die”, providing us with hope
for the future. So, in the immortal words of Tiny Tim: &quot;$Deity bless us,
every one!&quot;</p>

<h2>Biography</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chris is a freelance programmer who started out as a bedroom
coder in the 80’s writing assembly language on 8-bit micros. These days it's
enterprise grade technology <s>in plush corporate offices</s> from the comfort
of his breakfast bar. He also commentates on the Godmanchester duck race and is
easily distracted by emails and DMs to <a href="mailto:gort@cix.co.uk">gort@cix.co.uk</a>
