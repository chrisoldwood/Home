<h3>Session Description</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The use of branches within a version control system is a
risk management technique. They are commonly used to minimise the risk of
unanticipated side-effects when releasing critical changes to production, or to
minimise the disruption to developer productivity when making changes to the
base product. But branching is not the only means of managing risk and that is
what this talk addresses – the forces that drive the use of branches, what are
their problems, and what are the alternatives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Branching during the evolution of a software product, either
its over-use or complete avoidance, is just as susceptible to the malaise of
the &quot;cargo cult&quot; as many other areas of development. The choice is
not always made based on an informed decision with a careful weighing up of the
pros and cons and their alternatives, but purely by following what practices
the &quot;cool&quot; companies are (seen to be) using.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What is often misunderstood is how the same risks that
historically have been mitigated through the use of branches might now be
handled via the use of other, non-version-control related practices to ensure
stability and productivity remains high in the face of continued change. Whilst
there is still a time and a place for the use of branches we will discover when
that might be, but equally spend as much time exploring the complimentary
practices that help us to avoid their pitfalls.</p>
