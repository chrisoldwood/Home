<p class=MsoTitle><span lang=EN-US>Afterwood</span></p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>10 years ago today (as I write) I created a
blog and published my first post. It was to be the start of a new chapter in my
career as a programmer spurred on by my fairly recent introduction to the world
of ACCU which itself came about through lamenting the demise of the major printed
programming journals on the company’s chat tool.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>My decision to begin writing was not an
easy one though. For a start my English exam results as a teenager were somewhat
abysmal, so bad in fact the exam board wouldn't even give me a grade (a ‘U’ for
those familiar with the ‘80s English school system)! I eventually passed my English
Language exam, but not without a struggle. I thought developing software would
have little to do with &quot;proper&quot; writing and so it wouldn't matter in
the long run; I couldn't have been more wrong.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Aside from the act of writing itself, which
I had accidentally started to do anyway through some lengthy diatribes dressed
up as emails about the state of the architecture and codebase I was working on
at the time, the other major concern I had was around originality. What was I
going to write about? If there was something I had learned from all my time
spent reading up to that point, it was that so much had already been said, what
could I possibly say that was new? In particular I’d only really worked in “the
Enterprise” which is hardly a breeding ground for cool and exciting new
inventions in the world of software. If that wasn’t enough StackOverflow had
recently taken off and was fast becoming a major source of knowledge that
looked to be the nail in the coffin for many shorter topics which seemed to be
a nice way to ease oneself into the writing process.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>What I came to discover was that neither of
these concerns were really anything that I should have been quite so worried
about. Writing, much like programming, is something which you can only get
better at by doing. What had made those emails particularly hard to write was
getting the tone right so that they framed the problems in a light that was positive
rather than simply sounding like an empty rant. I wanted the problems to be
acknowledged and to inspire my team to think about how we could improve matters
going forward. Consequently I found myself continually reading back what I’d
read, and then re-writing bits, again and again until I felt I had finally
expressed myself in a way that I hoped was somewhat inspirational. I don’t know
why it took me so long to recognize that what I was already doing with code –
continually reviewing and refactoring to best express the solution – was
perfectly normal when writing prose too. And naturally as I got better I found
myself triangulating towards a piece I became happy with much sooner and
therefore the experience became more enjoyable as a result.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It’s probably no surprise that the more you
do of both - programming and writing – the more interesting parallels you
discover between them because, after all they’re both about languages with
rules where ambiguity can have unfortunate effects. As such I’ve found an
unexpected feedback loop developing, where my interest in programming languages
has generated an interest in natural languages too, where for a long time there
was only really disdain. This in turn has generated a degree of confidence that
has caused me to consider being more adventurous in my writing style.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Looking at the subject from the content
perspective what I’ve found is that originality is essentially a moot point
because as an industry we seem to spend a considerable amount of time
rediscovering ideas and concepts from the past. In part I suspect that is
because there is still a considerable gap between the theory and practice of
programming due to the imperfections and limitations of the tools we use. Hence
there is a continual need to bridge the theoretical and practical worlds by
framing the discussion in the context of different toolsets and problem domains
as this helps the message to get though to different people. Coupled with the
imperfections and limitations in our writing this means any given topic can,
and must, be said in a number of different voices to help others relate to what
we are saying. Just as one size does not fit all, neither does one explanation,
which is exemplified by the number of people who have attempted to explain what
a Monad is.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>There is also a heavy bias in the industry
to focus on what the “cool kids” are doing in places like Silicon Valley
despite the fact that the large majority of jobbing programmers are not
involved in greenfield work. While it is useful and interesting to know what
new stuff looms on the horizon I also want to know how some this can be applied
under the tight constraints of the aging brownfield codebases which my day job
entails. A lack of knowledge sharing from those in older establishments is less
surprising when you understand what constraints they apply around protecting
intellectual property despite the fact that what many of them are producing is
anything but rocket science. As such I’ve become happy to help populate the
body of technical literature which helps document the experiences of how one
person has tried to apply their ever growing tree of knowledge to what might be
considered by some to be the less glamorous world of the maintenance
programmer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>My decision to start recording my observations
and practice using the written word has undoubtedly been fulfilling. At the
very least I have been able to refer back to my own notes when the same issue
turns up again, but occasionally I have also been fortunate enough to learn
that other people have benefitted too, and that alone still makes it all
worthwhile.</span></p>
