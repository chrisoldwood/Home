<p class=MsoTitle>Afterwood</p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the Earth closes in on another complete loop of the Sun
and one more season of this journal comes to an end we first need to pass
through the year's final major holiday - Christmas. This is a magical time of
the year for both children and adults as that jolly, larger-then-life fellow in
a red suit pays us a visit. Sadly, some of the mystique surrounding how he
manages to circumnavigate the globe in such a short period of time has been
dispelled due to the event being live streamed by NORAD. Santa's big mistake,
like so many of us Internet users, was to accept cookies and now his every move
is being tracked. When Google first revealed its 'map/reduce' technology I
wondered if industrial espionage might have allowed them to expose one of Santa's
biggest secrets, but his tech still remains safe for the time being, although I
do wonder if their original motto of 'Don't be Evil' was simply a ploy to get
on his good side. One thing’s for sure, Santa must be a big fan of The Gang of
Four as he takes the Visitor pattern very seriously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For those of us in the UK there is the annual disappointment
of hoping for a “white” Christmas despite knowing full well that the changing
climate has probably put that out of reach for the foreseeable future. Maybe if
you can find a couple of ageing mainframe programmers and can antagonise them
with a fiendish text manipulation problem you might provoke a SNOBOL fight. Of
course, baiting people is not going to earn you a place on Santa's more
favourable list, and you can't take a leaf out of the Linux playbook and simply
invoke yourself with 'nice', you just have to get on with <i>actually</i> being
nice. Some parents try to incentivise their children over the festive period,
but we've always preferred the long game; the only ELF you'll find on our
shelves lives in the library as a chapter in a book about binary file formats.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you look close enough Christmas is a time of data
structures - lists, maps, and those all-important trees. Santa's choice of a
list for the containers of who's been naughty and who's been nice is certainly
a curious one, although if there is one data structure that has wildly varying characteristics
depending on which programming language you choose it's the humble list - it
might be singly linked, doubly linked, or even array-like. With billions of
people to manage I can only imagine he uses Big HO notation to choose his
implementation wisely. I suspect the reason he checks it twice is due to all
those pointers and the need for an address sanitizer. Either way he must be
storing our names using narrow strings because it's a time for no
L&quot;&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While lists might be the focus for Santa, us mere mortals
have trees to contend with. Every year December starts with the difficult task
of choosing a tree, but then, even more importantly it needs to be decorated.
If there is one thing you can never get agreement on it's how best to traverse
it: pre-order, in-order, or post-order?! Being the impetuous sort, the kids
like to visit the leaves too early by plastering them with tinsel meaning that
the lights have to be surgically inserted later. Despite favouring a trunk-based
approach I'm not afraid to admit that feature branches have their place too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Irrespective of how much effort we put into the upper
regions of the tree it's Santa who is responsible for most of what lies around
the base. Much like the role of an Enterprise Architect he does little of the
work himself, preferring instead to farm it out to the little people. Also like
an Enterprise Architect you can always spot those presents he handled himself because
of the excessive amount of wrapping. I've always felt elves would probably make
good C# and Java programmers due to their expertise with boxing although many are
probably destined to work at Microsoft in the Office team as they also seem
obsessed with ribbons. At least we haven’t reached the point where requesting
presents from Santa has degenerated into raising a JIRA ticket.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By the time we reach our Christmas lunch Santa will be back
home and resting after rushing around the globe grappling with time-zones. (Dates
are a popular festive snack too though fortunately <i>they</i> only come in two
formats – pitted or unpitted.) Lunch in the UK typically consists of turkey, although
GOOS is popular with the TDD crowd, along with a varied selection of trimmings,
such as credential stuffing for those in the infosec business. They aren’t the
only ones battling with crackers though, everyone gets to partake in wearing a
thin paper crown and reading out a pitiful Christmas themed joke. For those of
you who have never had the (dis)pleasure of pulling crackers then let this episode
of Afterwood be my present to you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Merry Christmas and a happy New Year!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chris is a freelance programmer who started out as a bedroom
coder in the 80’s writing assembler on 8-bit micros. These days it's enterprise
grade technology <s>in plush corporate offices</s> from the comfort of his
breakfast bar. He has resumed commentating on the Godmanchester duck race but
continues to be easily distracted by emails and DMs to gort@cix.co.uk and
