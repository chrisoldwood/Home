<h1 align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>ACCU Conference
2014</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Another 12 months has flown by and I find
myself heading down to Bristol for the ACCU annual conference. This will be my
7<sup>th</sup> year in attendance and 4<sup>th</sup> time speaking – I think
I’m beginning to get the hang of this now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Last year saw the move to the new venue in Bristol; this year it’s more likely to be business as usual as we’ll all know where the
various rooms, bar and toilets are. Any teething troubles (not that I personally
noticed any) will likely be ironed out and hopefully we can now just relax and
enjoy the show.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Here’s how it went for me…</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Tuesday</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Despite not going to any of the tutorials I
was still treated to an unexpected talk by Uncle Bob as the hotel was also
playing host to the Batch &amp; Bristol Scrum Group. So, whilst not technically
an ACCU event it was nonetheless a good start to my conference program. He gave
a short session about the past and possible future of Agile, with a particular
emphasis on Kent Beck’s original notion of healing the divide between
developers and The Business. This was a great reminder of why we do the
practices we do.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Wednesday</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The opening keynote came from Bill Liao who
helped a school kid set up a not-for-profit coding dojo in Ireland to help teach kids programming. Naturally it’s grown and has gone multi-national but the key
point seems to be that it’s run by, and for kids which is a great achievement.
The boy/girl ratio is almost equal in some cases and their mantra of “Be Cool”
has helped maintain a positive attitude. It was certainly an inspirational
start to the week’s proceedings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Clearly Didier Verna’s persistence has paid
off because I chose Uncle Bob for my first session which was about how Clojure
is the new C. The first half of his talk was pretty much a cut-down version of
his Requiem for C keynote from a few years’ back where he laments how far most
of us are now abstracted from the hardware. Given this, his argument was that
LISP, perhaps in the form of Clojure, provides a modern “high-level assembly
language”. While I agreed with many of his points I think I’ll still find
writing expressions in infix notion more convenient.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The lunchtime break was followed by Charles
Bailey’s talk on Git archaeology. Now that I’ve used Git for 9 months I felt
prepared to tackle some of the more hardcore Git tools. After a brief recap of
the Git object model he provided a number of examples to show how you can
slice-and-dice the log to unearth useful details about the changes in your
commit history. Making sense of merge commits is definitely essential and he
provided some good advice there too after showing us some real-life octopus
merges.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>My final session for the day was spent with
 Roger Orr who was attempting show what Order Notation is, and more importantly,
how it can be used in practice. With the mathematical definitions out of the
way Roger, in his own inimitable way, took the seemingly obvious case of
strlen() and showed how in extreme cases it can stop being O(N) and be much
worse (think page faults). He then showed a more traditional use when tackling
the many different ways you can create a sorted container of integers by using both
sorted and non-sorted containers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The 15-minute lightning talks were back
again this year to provide a backdrop to the shorter 5-minute versions that run
on Thursday and Friday. For the third time this week I got to see Uncle Bob,
this time giving his views on what our Professional Disciplines should be if
regulation were ever to rear its ugly head. Next up Nico Josuttis gave an
impassioned plea to consider what is happening to our privacy and what we, as
programmers, can do to help provide the tools to enable more secure
communication.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I followed Nico with a (possibly deluded)
attempt to cast code snippets in a slightly humorous modern-art style. Steve
Freeman then continued the more classical lightning talk tone by explaining why
the Given/When/Then style of tests can be unnecessarily verbose as we try to
tackle the contorted language that often comes from writing this style of test.
Finally Pete Goodliffe concluded the day with a short and amusing poem about
code.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Thursday</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Four years ago Dan North failed to make his
conference keynote due to volcano problems. Luckily this year it went without a
hitch as he tried to explain why Agile doesn’t scale. This was an interesting
and entertaining talk as he explained how the same principles we apply at
team-scale just don’t work when applied at the organisation level. Whilst I know
first-hand of the effects of “Enterprise Scale” development it was good to
understand more about what (supposedly) drives the middle and higher tiers of
management.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I chose Wojciech Seliga’s talk to take me
up to lunch which was about the problems faced dealing with the high volume of
automated tests that covers a variety of different build configurations and
platforms for their JIRA product. This was a really good talk as it covered
both the quality of the tests themselves, the attitudes of the developers
working on them and the performance of the build pipeline. There was lots of
good stuff to take away and think about.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>After a spot of lunch I decided to go with
two shorter talks. The first was Continuous Delivery with Legacy Code by Dan
Swain &amp; Leon Hewitt which was about the architectural refactoring work they
had needed to do to support use of a secure 3<sup>rd</sup> party payment
service. Whilst the narrative was very interesting due to the constraints
imposed by the secure service, I felt the use of “Continuous Delivery” in the
title was somewhat misleading.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>This talk was immediately followed by Sven
Rosvall who showed how modern mocking tools can be used directly on concrete
types and static methods as an alternative to introducing interfaces or proxies
into your design. The tools do some low-level jiggery-pokery to the underlying
virtual machine to work around the normal mocking limitations and he showed a
couple of examples in both .Net and Java. Whilst it’s good to have tools like
this I wasn’t the only one left wondering whether they would be used as an
excuse to avoid refactoring or coming up with a better design.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>My final session that day was to be with
James Grenning. Even though I haven’t written any C in 15-odd years I have
worked on some OO-style C codebases and I was intrigued to see how he was going
to apply the classic SOLID principles to a non-natively OO language. It all worked
surprisingly well given the lack of built-in polymorphism and the Single
Responsibility Principle always pays dividends. It’s amazing how much
unnecessary gunk we can encapsulate and avoid leaking in our header files. We
then watched him write some C code TDD-style that made me wish I’d known that 20
years ago!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The first set of twelve 5-minute lightning
talks got underway after a break with Francis Glassborow describing how
important it is that programmers learn multiple languages of both the computer
and natural kinds. The others included Charles Bailey pointed out Git’s use of
the colour red instead of green to denote deleted code, Thaddaeus Frogley did a
primer on the graphics pipeline, Dirk Haun with neat wearable camera, Andy Balaam
wowed us with programs that generate themselves and Dmytro Mindra convinced us
it’s good for geeks to get up and talk.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Friday</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Didier Verna provided us with the Friday
keynote titled “Biological Realms in Computer Science”. This was an engaging
talk that delved into the similarities between Biology and Computer Science.
The analogies between cells and computers were fascinating and he had many
excellent quotes to draw upon to supplement his apparent fondness for the T-800
Terminator.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Whilst the vast majority of talks are
obviously relevant to our day-to-day jobs as programmers there is still room
for some more leftfield sessions that address our other needs as a human being.
Phil Nash’s talk looked into the idea of healthy body/healthy mind to remind us
that our effectiveness as a programmer depends heavily on the way we look after
ourselves, or not. Instead of just looking superficially at our diet he delved
right down into the chemistry to tell us in more detail about what it is we’re
eating. The background for this was his own impressive personal journey to look
after himself better and in turn improve his cognitive abilities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Two years ago at the ACCU conference I
purchased a copy Overload Issue 8 (amongst others) and it contained an article
by one Kevlin Henney about immutability. That article provided the starting
point for an excellent talk about how we can use immutability more effectively,
especially when concurrency is involved. Jon Skeet predicated the Java Date
class would feature at some point and he wasn’t disappointed. He even did a
good job of trying to convince us that editing his slides to fix a coding error
wasn’t a state change.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The late afternoon slot was the easiest
choice to make of the whole event as it was time for my own talk. I knew I’d
picked a contentious topic – version control practices – but luckily the flame-war
was reserved for the bar afterwards.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Another short break and the second set of
lightning talks were underway. Due to the hotel getting the main room ready for
the dinner, we all squeezed into one of the smaller rooms and sadly many
couldn’t fit in! Once again there were twelve talks with Ed Sykes kicking off
the set by explaining about the Quantified Dev project he’s working on. Some of
the other talks included Emyr Williams answering Pete Goodliffe’s call to
become a better programmer, Alisdair Meredith showing us what’s coming up in
C++ 14, Frank Birbacher describing colour spaces, a poem from Charles Tolman
and a somewhat harrowing account of what happened in Ukraine from Dmytro Mindra.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>At the beginning I said the big change
happened last year, but there was another significant change this year - the
conference dinner. For a start the menu was less traditional; which was not
surprising given the Bollywood Banquet theme. The tables surrounded a dance
floor and we were treated to some wonderful Bollywood music and dancing between
courses. We also got to join in and strut our stuff, plus there was a “dance
off” between the US and UK, although I’m not sure exactly what prize victory
brought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Of course some things never change and we soon
retired to the bar until far too late to chew over the week’s events and life
in general.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Saturday</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I’m sure one day I’ll grow up and go to bed
at a responsible time during the conference. Until that day comes I’m probably
going to keep missing the opening sessions on the Saturday morning (hint, hint,
start them later) and with me leaving early I only got to see one talk. It was
also the only C++ talk I attended – Anthony Williams on the future of C++
concurrency. This was a detailed look into some of the proposals that might
feature in the next standard (at the moment some are already documented in a TS).
Anthony took us through continuations, executors and schedulers to show how we might
compose, control and manage our task workload. Naturally std:async and std::future
got to feature heavily, not least because of the contentious nature of their
lifetimes.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>On Reflection</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I’ve been out of the professional C++
programming world for a few years so that makes it marginally easier to choose my
sessions because I don’t feel duty bound to go to them all. Anything that can
help narrow the selection process is a must if a decision is ever to be made at
all. Dithering too long can be the difference between fitting in the room and
having to start the selection process all over again! </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>As I sat on the train on the way back home
I remembered how annoyed I was at having to put Breaking Bad season 4 to one
side whilst I came to the conference. Clearly the 4 days were pretty intense
because I never once thought about what else I might be doing instead (spending
time with the wife and kids notwithstanding). It just goes to show that 7 years
on it still hasn’t lost its magic.</span></p>
