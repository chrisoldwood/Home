<h1 align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>In The Toolbox –
Taming the Inbox</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>One of the things you get to deal with in “The
Enterprise” is how to manage the ton of email you get every day. For some
reason corporate culture loves it. And I hold my hand up too as being one of
those people who has probably overused it. Your inbox is bombarded every day by
emails from various sources, such as the company’s latest results or PR
exercise, support notifications to keep you “in the loop”, location aware
messages to find the owner of the dropped mobile phone, meeting invites, etc.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>What I find confusing is the number of
people who deal with this by burying their head in the sand, i.e. they just
leave everything in their inbox and make no attempt to configure their email
client to relieve (some) of the burden. When you do send them an email they
seem surprised when you follow up in person and they say “sorry, I didn’t see
that message”. In many cases these are developers who would never dream of
sticking all their source files in a single source folder, and yet the same
rules to manage complexity in software don’t seem to apply to email.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>In one sense I envy their attitude towards
email - I wish I could be so blasé about the whole affair and just grumble
about how much it interrupts my day and is just another distraction from
writing code. But the thing is, it isn’t and hasn’t been for a long time as
I’ve learnt to manage it, just as I’ve learnt to manage the complexity of the
code I work <span class=GramE>on</span>. What follows below are the practices
I’ve developed to manage my email load. Of course one size never fits all, but
you may either find some solace in my habits or confirm my position as a slave
to an anachronism.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Message Status</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Given the environments I work in Microsoft
Outlook is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>the</i> email client of choice
and it has one of the worst default settings I’ve ever come across: “mark item as
read when selection changes”. This means that every time you click (or cursor
up/down) to another message in your inbox the previous one will be marked as
read – irrespective of whether you actually read it or not. Given that your
focus is on the target email, not the ones along your journey, you probably
won’t even notice the change in status of the ones you accidentally clicked on.
If you are going to leave everything in your inbox, the read/unread status is probably
the only way you’re going to know what you have and have not attended to, so
you owe it to yourself to switch this off. I don’t leave emails in my inbox but
I still turn it off as the “read status” is one of my indicators for what I’ve
yet to attend to.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Our esteemed C Vu editor informs me that this
is also the default setting on a number of other email clients. If anyone can enlighten
me to why this is the choice of the masses please send a postcard to the usual
address, i.e. accu-general.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Filtering Messages</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>My primary filter for what order to look at
emails is not whether it’s been read or not, but which folder it’s in. After
turning off the setting above I start to consider how I need to filter any
incoming email so that stuff that is likely to demand my attention stays in the
inbox (i.e. my highest priority mailbox) whilst the less exciting emails end up
in some other folder. In either case it remains in an unread state as even the
lowest priority of emails <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>may</i> have
some redeeming content unless I know for sure I will have no false positives
with a rule (e.g. I can match on an email address from an automated account).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>As a general rule anything not addressed
directly to me, or directly to my team’s email distribution list(s) goes into
the bin (the Deleted Items folder in Outlook). So much email comes through on
so many email lists that aggregate various other lists ad infinitum that it
would be a chore to continue maintaining the default rule by adding each new
corporate spam list as it shows up. Hence I prefer a white-list to a
black-list, where the white-list is me and my team mates.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>That simple rule often suffices for many
organisations, but it depends on how entrenched you are in the company, or
whether you have a support role as well. Support is often done through an email
list that I may or may not be interested in depending on the support rota. As
such I may create a custom folder, perhaps under the Inbox, for mail addressed
to the support account.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I have known an organisation get wise to
this “tactic” of filtering internal spam by using read receipts to monitor
consumption. They then started addressing mail to everyone directly (or perhaps
it was just me because they knew I was not only binning it, but marking it as read
automatically too). For these occasions the other filtering rules can usually
be effective, such as matching a text string like “Monthly Update from the
CEO”. Hopefully by now we’ve reduced the burden so much that the odd false
negative is not too onerous to deal with manually.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>When to Read</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I know many people find email a huge
distraction and dislike being interrupted when in a state of “flow”. Personally
it’s been so long since I’ve ever achieved a state of flow I’m not sure what it
looks like. A large part of that is probably down to having 4 children - their
constant need for attention means I’ve developed the ability to context switch
at will. Whether I’m anywhere near as effective being this way is likely open
to debate, but it does mean I can attend to trivial emails without really
pausing for thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The little envelope that Outlook displays
in the notification tray can either be a useful little reminder to catch up on
your mail or a horrible nag depending on how distracting you find tray icons.
Toast-style notifications at least answer the question that the little icon
only teases at – who’s it from and could it <span class=GramE>be</span> worth
reading now? However their effectiveness even for someone like me depends on
them being the exception rather than the norm. In an email heavy environment
all these indicators, along with playing a sound when a new message arrives, can
seem like you’re at a fireworks display.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>One problem with being elevated from
last-through-the-door to longest-serving-member means that you acquire an awful
lot of knowledge and experience that others (unfortunately) start to rely on.
Even if I’m not the only one that knows the answer, if I feel someone is
blocked in their work and I have the ability to reply quickly and that would
unblock them, then I feel the team wins. However this kind of helpfulness does
nothing to improve your own productivity and can lead to awkward questions if
your company measures value in lines of code.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>As such my emails are dealt with in one of
two ways. If the email is relatively short and can be answered within a couple
of minutes I’ll just do it there and then. Rather than handle a single email,
naturally I’ll handle all the quick ones in succession. Of course because I do
it that way my inbox never accumulates and so it mostly stays empty. Any that
are too long to read or reply to immediately stay marked as unread so that I
know I still need to look at them properly later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>That generally leaves the longer emails
addressed to me and any others that were filtered automatically into the lower
priority folders. These I can tackle at a time when a natural break occurs,
such as running the clean + build + tests after integration and before checking
in, or after one story is finished and I’m ready to pick up the next, or before
resuming a story after having coffee/lunch, etc. This kind of email tends to be
pretty rare these days as it can often be converted to a formal project task if
the answer would be better served as a wiki page, or by teeing up a
face-to-face chat to explore a problem directly (high-bandwidth communication).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>If I’m on support then the priorities
change so that I scan the support folder first and will probably interrupt my
flow to handle a potentially lengthy support email as that is usually far more
important.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Finally that just leaves the stuff that
goes straight in the bin, but still marked unread, which I’m pretty sure is
just junk. Most of the time I won’t even go passed the subject line and will
either block select and mark as read or use the folder option “mark all items
read” for ease. Very occasionally something interesting gets filtered by
mistake and so I might dealt with it then or move it back to my inbox to peruse
later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>You might have noticed I’ve not mentioned
the message priority anywhere. That’s because I completely ignore it. Putting
the word “URGENT” in the subject line in capital letters does not make me feel
the need to respond any quicker either. The priority flag is usually just an indication
of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>their</i> work priorities, not mine.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Message Archives</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Back when disk space was measured in MB it
was not possible to keep every email sent, especially when they contained
attachments. These days it’s entirely possible to never delete anything ever
again. The problem now is searching a vast email archive for the answer to that
question you’ve just been asked… once again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Rather than leave all my mail in the Inbox
or “soft-deleting” by moving it to the Deleted Items folder I developed a habit
of creating a top-level archive folder with a set of suitably named sub-folders
used to group emails into more manageable chunks. For example on my current
project, which I’ve only been in for a few weeks, I already have the following
folders: Build, Design, Infrastructure, Releases, Security and Tools. In
essence I group emails just like I group code into namespaces.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Once I joined the corporate circle I found
this technique to be very valuable. It has proved to be a good defence
mechanism to remind both team insiders and outsiders about a prior conversation
when amnesia appears to have set in. One manager I worked for asked the same
question time-and-again and so I used to dig out the last copy of the email I
forwarded him and prefixed it once more with “Here it is, again”. This kind of
passive-aggressive behaviour changed nothing of their behaviour but at least I
got to chuckle as the email grew longer and longer with each new occurrence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Earlier I mentioned that I can often answer
an email very quickly and this easily searchable archive is one reason why that
becomes possible. Even with years of accumulated emails it becomes relatively
easy to find stuff. Naturally the tool’s search feature is a good start, and
narrowing to just one folder speeds things up immensely. Sometimes though I
can’t remember a distinct enough term to search on and so a manual search is
required. This might seem like the proverbial “needle in a haystack” but with a
good folder structure you’ll be surprised how quickly you can hone in on
something just by flicking down the subject lines.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>So, what do I archive? I keep every
non-trivial, team-relevant conversation that passes by my inbox. Although in
some cases I have kept even the replies that just say “thanks” as proof that
the email must have been read by the recipient (in case they plead ignorance).
That might seem like a lot of mail but once you have a good archive structure
it only takes moments to read it and file it away. In the past I tried to keep
only the most recent message in any conversation but I found that became more
of a burden and if the thread <span class=GramE>diverged</span> it became hard
to know which to keep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>One other reason for not just leaving
everything in the bin or the inbox (if you want a record kept <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>somewhere</i>) is that some companies have a
policy of deleting mail older than, say, 3 months in either of these two folders.
Ironically, rather than attempt to reduce its dependency on the tool they
prefer to recycle the storage more quickly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Occasionally one archive topic’s folder might
get too general and so I then split it or create subfolders. I leave the
existing pile in place and then start afresh which creates a sort of
multi-level cache when searching. However these days I’ve done it so many times
that I generally adopt the same structure each time and have a feel for what
sort of breakdown is likely to work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>My original goal for all this hoarding was
to allow me to dump the entire contents of my mailbox into a .pst file on some
file share when I left so that any knowledge acquired was still accessible to
others after my departure. While I have done this on later contracts I didn’t
in the early days because I was fearful that an email with a sensitive
conversation in it might leak out. Consequently my desire to be able to just
dump my mailbox on exit has helped keep me a little more honest too.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Handling Request Timeouts</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Most replies will either be part of an
ongoing conversation, in which case the original email can be archived, or will
involve me firing off a request to which I will eventually expect a reply. I
like to manage my Sent Items folder in a manner similar to my inbox (it is a
mirror image after all) so I archive <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>sent</i>
emails too alongside the ones received.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I used to use a special archive folder called
“_pending” (the leading underscore sorts the mailbox at the top) to act as a reminder
of how far the conversation has gone. However I eventually realised that by
emptying the Sent Items folder in the same way as my Inbox I could leave
pending items in there instead.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Treat the Disease</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>By now I suspect many of you are screaming
at this article telling me to treat the disease, not the symptoms. And you
would be right. In some cases the burden of team communication by email has
lessened over the years as common uses have been replaced by the daily stand-up,
pair programming, code reviews, IRC style chat [1], wikis, feature trackers, etc.
Convincing your own team to make better use of face-to-face communication or
other tools is usually within your own control.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The question is how to convince those
outside your control that you don’t want the deluge of spam directed at you.
Where’s the link at the bottom of the weekly timesheet reminder that allows me
to unsubscribe? Perhaps corporate email software will one day evolve to a point
where all email lists become opt-in, not impossible to opt-out of. Until that
day comes I’ll continue to opt-out where possible using automatic filtering
rules and opt-in for stuff that actually has some value for me and my team.</span></p>
