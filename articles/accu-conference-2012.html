<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Another year had flown by and all of a
sudden the annual ACCU Conference was upon me once more. This being my fifth
year I was pretty comfortable that I knew roughly what to expect. However a
change in hands of both the conference chair (now Jon <span class=SpellE>Jagger</span>)
and the hotel owner (whilst we were staying there!) meant that there was always
going to be something new to delight us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span lang=EN-GB>Tuesday<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The main conference is preceded by a
tutorial day that I didn’t attend this year. For those trying to digest as much
about C++11 as possible this would have been a fine start as <span
class=SpellE>Nico</span> was back in the fold with an update to his fine book
on the C++ Standard Library. Not that the other two options – Java garbage
collector tuning and IT design/architecture – should be glossed over, but C++
11 definitely appeared to be the primary focus.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I arrived early that evening with the
intended goal of checking out my presentation on a projector, but after
checking in and walking back towards the main part of the hotel I bumped into
various people that I’ve not seen since last year. So I decided that a quick
pint and catch-up wouldn’t hurt as there was plenty of time before tomorrow. I
guess some of us just never learn…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span lang=EN-GB>Wednesday<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tim Lister got to kick-off this year’s
conference keynotes with a talk on Project Patterns, on which he and his
colleagues have written a new book. He suggested that Project Habits would have
been a more suitable name as it was not about defining best practices but
documenting common behaviours. Although he courted controversy with Lessons
Unlearned the one that generated the most interest was Dead Fish – a project
that smells rotten but nobody’s willing to speak up about it. This was a
delightful start to the conference that set the tone in more ways than one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>As someone who does little C++ these days I
wasn’t there to soak up all the C++ 11 goodies, but I still wanted to keep my
eye in. C++ has its share of warts and <span class=SpellE>Nico</span> <span
class=SpellE>Josuttis</span> put together a talk on the Best &amp; Worst New
Features that nicely illustrated how to get the most out of the recent changes,
but more importantly identified some of the new traps you may fall into. And
there are a few peaches! I think overall <span class=SpellE>Nico</span> had
more Best than Worst features to discuss so it’s clearly a net gain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The lunchtime routine changed slightly this
year and it felt as though the bottleneck of past years was now behind us – I
certainly got served more quickly each day. So I had ample time to chat before
spending my early afternoon listening to <span class=SpellE>Detlef</span> <span
class=SpellE>Vollmnan</span> describe Parallel Architectures. This session was
a nice spot of revision on the changes in CPU architectures over the last
decade and a look forward to what we can expect in the near future. He briefly covered
the classic problem with the Double-Checked Lock pattern to illustrate how
re-ordering under the covers affects us and also the costs associated with NUMA
configurations. This provided a pleasant prelude to a talk I would attend the
following morning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Last year I gave my first ever talk and so
I was hoping that by this year I’d have learned some new tricks and would give
a slightly more polished show. I think the slides were a little more colourful
and I felt brave enough to do a little live coding that I hope added to the
experience. With a strong C++11 track I wasn’t expecting to get many interested
in TDD based database development, but there were more than enough still awake
at the end to make me feel pleased with my efforts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The lightning talks are now a staple part
of the conference and provide a forum at the tale end of the day to either add
a poignant finale to a keynote or allow the more disgruntled among us to let
off steam with a good old rant. There is generally more of the latter which was
perfectly illustrated by Pete Goodliffe with some choice examples from his
current codebase. On the more constructive side Jonathan <span class=SpellE>Wakely</span>
reminded us about the virtues of <span class=SpellE>shared_ptr</span> and <span
class=SpellE>make_shared</span> in particular. Aaron <span class=SpellE>Ridout</span>
got to reply to a talk from <span class=SpellE>Seb</span> Rose last year
suggesting that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> taking up new
employee references can be detrimental to your company too. With 8 talks on the
first night there was clearly no problem finding willing volunteers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span lang=EN-GB>Thursday<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It was business as usual Thursday morning
as I bolted down my fry-up to get to the keynote after a late night in the bar
chewing various programming ‘fats’. Phil Nash had the honour of representing <span
class=SpellE>ACCU’s</span> home-grown talent with a piece titled The Congruent
Programmer. Given that he could barely speak a week before due to a nasty cold
he did an excellent job of trying to answer that tricky question about what it
is that drives us and what introspection might help us to develop ourselves in
the future. I thought the analogy to the Alexander Technique was a little
tenuous but his point was well made.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>After the morning coffee break I decided I
needed to feed my concurrency habit further and so embraced Russel Winder’s
talk on the multi-core revolution. Russel is not shy of telling us how wrong
the shared memory approach is and that the Actor, <span class=SpellE>DataFlow</span>
and CSP models are the way forward. To him shared memory multi-threading is
technique for OS implementers, not application programmers. He decided to
cement these ideas by implementing the various forms in Go, D and C++ to show
how they might look; with an eye on whether the new C++ threading additions are
too little too late as it doesn’t have the high-level constructs, yet. Given
what I had planned to see in the afternoon this was a fine bit of middle
ground.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The vast majority of the sessions after
lunch were 45 minutes long so I decided to pick two opposite views on the state
of the C language – Dirk <span class=SpellE>Haun’s</span> Is C going the Way of
the dodo and Andrew <span class=SpellE>Stitcher’s</span> When Only C will do.
The former was part-musing from the speaker and part-workshop to allow the audience
to provide some thoughts on why there are still so many C programmers and
whether that will continue. It was interesting listening to the various
opinions and small doses of nostalgia always goes down well. I felt a little
less satisfied by the follow-up talk because I didn’t find the argument for
pure C to be at all compelling (as opposed to using a subset of C++). Andrew’s
example did reinforce the notion that C is the common ground between all
languages due to its ABI, but perhaps sometimes it’s only the C ABI that will
do, not necessarily the entire language…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>More coffee was required before my final concurrency
session, this time with Anthony Williams. I wondered if I had entered a
parallel universe with Russel talking earlier about C++ and Anthony using
Groovy for his examples! This was a great companion to that earlier session
because Anthony added in the Active Object pattern and Loop Parallelism too. He
also used his own Just Thread library to show how you can build on the C++11
standard library to give the higher-order mechanisms for the actor and dataflow
models.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The second round of lightning talks gave
Phil Nash a chance to extend his keynote further by providing a heart-warming
tale about one particular user of his C++ unit testing framework Catch. Matt
Turner vented anger on fluent style interfaces whilst Charles Bailey tackled
the classic Law of Three. It wouldn’t be an ACCU conference without Didier
Verna pointing out the superiority of LISP and he kindly obliged.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The Xbox Connect Challenge provided an
amusing backdrop to the evening’s proceedings in the hotel bar as grown men
(and women) were flinging themselves around in an attempt to outdo one another.
Pete Goodliffe set a good early pace, but his crown was soon taken and the
high-score rose to the heights of the more hardened gamers. There were
definitely a few sore limbs the following morning for those that let the
alcohol fuel their competitiveness. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span lang=EN-GB>Friday<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Uncle Bob had the pleasure of entertaining
us on the Friday morning with a Requiem for C. After going to two sessions the
previous day on the topic it was interesting to see what spin he would put on
its demise. There was a fair amount of personal background to start with that
finally lead up to his eventual inauguration to C. Then we had the downward
slope as he tried to convince us that we are getting further and further away
from the metal with technologies such as the JVM and so consequently C’s value
is diminishing rapidly. Some may have bought this, but from the lightning talks
to follow others weren’t so easily taken in. He also wore a head-cam during the
keynote which should make for interesting viewing by others later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE><span lang=EN-GB>Devops</span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>, Infrastructure-as-code by Gavin <span class=SpellE>Heavyside</span>
was my first choice of the day. This was one of those thoroughly practical
talks that gives you insight into how others teams do stuff; the stuff in
question being continuous deployment and other <span class=SpellE>devops</span>
related activities such as monitoring. He took a deeper look at Chef, which is
used to manage deployments, and the DSL used in configuring/testing it and
explained how they perform zero-downtime deployments. The use of tweets from <span
class=SpellE>DevOps</span> <span class=SpellE>Borat</span> as a backdrop made
this all the more enjoyable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I find that I need to limit myself on the
number of sessions by Kevlin Henney as he makes me think too damn hard by
questioning the status quo, and with a title like SOLID Deconstruction you new
this was going to do just that. Last year he turned SOLID into just SID and
this year it became FLUID, although serious artistic license was required for
the D! The discussion of cohesion was particularly useful as it’s a term that’s
often banded about but not well defined. One thing I found most interesting,
but which was never highlighted, was the way that he named the test fixture and
test methods in one of his examples.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Sadly I spent too long chatting over coffee
to get into John <span class=SpellE>Lakos</span>’ talk and so I had to go find
another, and I’m really glad I did as <span class=SpellE>Jurgen</span> <span
class=SpellE>Appelo</span> was a pleasure to listen to. He took us through the
murky waters of Complexity Thinking and Systems Thinking to look at its failed
application to social systems such as software development. I thought this was
going to be way out of my league as I had no idea who any of the “experts”
were, but fortunately he translated the concepts into something us mere mortals
could understand and added a large dash of humour to keep the session from
drying up. It’s sessions like these that help break down the divide between
programmers and managers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The final round of 11 lightning talks
opened with Tom Gilb following up last years attempt to quantify love by
showing that music can be quantified. <span class=SpellE>Diomidis</span> <span
class=SpellE>Spinellis</span> tried to convince us that we should alias the
entire C++ library so that it follows Java naming conventions. <st1:PersonName
w:st="on">Ed Sykes</st1:PersonName> &amp; <span class=SpellE>Raj</span> Singh
explained how they had pushed pair programming to the next level with Posse
Programming and Bernhard <span class=SpellE>Merkle</span> responded to Uncle
Bob’s keynote by showing that C, albeit in a more modern non-standard form,
still matters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Friday night plays host to the speaker’s
dinner where delegates get the chance to wine and dine with those that have
preached to them during the last few days. Each course is met with a change of
table to ensure there is a constant stream of new faces to chat with, and a new
random element this year meant speakers could be forced to move too. Once again
coffee was served whilst an auction raised money for Bletchley Park and the
boat race made a welcome return too in the bar afterwards to battle out once
and for all whether C was really dead or not…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span lang=EN-GB>Saturday<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Even though the disruption caused by the
volcano was well and truly behind us the conference has maintained the format
of the lightning keynotes on the Saturday morning. These are 4 shorter keynotes
hosted by a variety of speakers. Naturally, over indulgence from the previous
night meant I missed the first two and so I started the day listening to Emily
Bache’s Geek Feminism. Emily took a look into what differs between men and
women to see what it might be about the way software development teams work
that might be off putting to women. She made a particularly poignant
observation that the Wisdom of Crowds is amplified by diversity and so being a
minority is actually highly beneficial. The final keynote was from <span
class=SpellE>Jurgen</span> <span class=SpellE>Appelo</span> that looked into
what motivates us. He took various established sets of core values and <span
class=SpellE>munged</span> them together to come up with his own variant that
goes by the rather long-winded acronym CHAMPFROGS!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Giovanni <span class=SpellE>Asproni</span>
has always been the conference chair when I’ve attended and so unshackled from
these duties he had the opportunity to host a session instead. This was on API
Usability and looked into what it means to design an API, whether that is for
public or private consumption. His example of how the Single Responsibility
Principle had been taken to the extreme was amusing but also enlightening. He
is never one to pass up the opportunity to berate the Singleton pattern, and
this occasion was no exception. Giovanni pulled together lots of little threads
to provide one of those bread-and-butter talks that reminds you of all the
little things you have to remember every day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>My final session of the conference was to
be with <span class=SpellE>Diomidis</span> <span class=SpellE>Spinellis</span> about
UML Graph, a tool to enable the generation of small UML diagrams using
annotated source code. The premise of generating model diagrams from source
code versus manual drawings was compelling and something I’ve been recently looking
into with Doxygen. He then went on to discuss other tools for generating different
sorts of diagrams and charts to give you plenty of options on how to
programmatically create them; a very informative end to the conference.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span lang=EN-GB>Epilogue<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The hardest part about coming home from 4
days at the ACCU conference is integrating oneself back into society. It’s an
intense few days where you can literally eat, drink and sleep all things about
programming. Depending on the kind of organisation you’re going back to you
might be bursting with energy just waiting to pass on all that valuable
knowledge, or perhaps you’re a small cog in a very big wheel with disinterested
co-workers. Either way <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>your</i>
participation means that you’ll be a better programmer for having gone and
ultimately that’s what it’s all about.</span></p>
