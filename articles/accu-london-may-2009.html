<p class=MsoTitle><span lang=EN-GB>Jeff Sutherland: Agile Software Development
in the Enterprise</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The May 2009 talk at the ACCU London branch
was given by Jeff Sutherland the co-creator of Scrum. This was a hugely popular
talk hosted at the JP Morgan premises allowing a greater number of attendees,
but even so a waiting list was needed. I was one of the 70 or so people lucky
enough to get a place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>As the title suggests the talk was aimed
squarely at those people that work in larger organisations or distributed
teams, perhaps where they are a little more sceptical about the scalability of
agile development practices. The blurb on the ACCU web site also describes “extraordinary
financial returns” in case anyone needed a further carrot to listen to one of
the founders of the Agile Alliance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jeff started with a brief introduction to
what Agile Development is, along with a look at the core values from the Agile
Manifesto and some of the other Agile Methods such as eXtreme Programming. However,
rather than just listing XP as another methodology, he actively promoted the
use of the XP technical disciplines such as TDD and Pair Programming. This was
highlighted further in a later slide that discussed a more symbiotic
relationship between Scrum and XP.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He swiftly moved on to the meat of Scrum
and spent some time discussing Velocity and how it is achieved. The key factors
appeared to be having a skilled Product Owner that drives the ‘Ready’ queue to
ensure the developers are sufficiently productive, and the features being
‘Done’ at a level accepted by the business. The first point rose the question
of what exactly is meant by “Ready” and how you find someone that is skilled
enough in the business to prepare items for developer consumption – which in
the Investment Banking world probably means a trader. However, they don’t come
cheap, but Jeff’s argument is that they would be worth their weight in gold as
they are the lynchpin. This somewhat surprising answer became perfect fodder
for the pub discussions later. The second point about items only being
considered ‘Done’ when they pass the business acceptance tests, was driven home
by a study that showed that 1 hour of immediate testing, when postponed, would
grow to become 23 hours of testing later. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>After another brief history lesson on how
Scrum was invented, Jeff started to go through some case studies to show where
they had achieved Hyper-productivity and in the case of one client where that
had translated into a significant growth in revenue – 8 times. Along the way we
learnt that 65% of requirements change and amusingly that 63% of features are
unused, not that any correlation was suggested mind you. The subject then
turned to how Scrum scales to large teams with thousands of developers and how even
an un-coached team can increase its velocity by 35%, but a coached team can
achieve an increase of 200 to 400%. Another favoured sound bite was “Never
outsource to waterfall teams”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The final two case studies were about
failed projects and were used to show how Distributed Scrum, not only scales,
but was also able to turn the projects around. Although the choice of “Lines of
Code” was not greeted as the best metric for rating productivity (which Jeff
agreed with) it did show where the project fortunes changed. Both studies were
also analysed using “Function Points per Developer/Month” to compare the real
projects with the expected velocity according to a previous smaller study which
compared Scrum to Waterfall (17.8 vs. 2.0) – they both came in a shade over 15.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Not unsurprisingly there were a barrage of
questions from the attendees and not nearly enough time to answer them all. The
only recourse was to seek out a watering hole and discuss the somewhat
compelling statistical information further over a few beers. Somehow we lost
focus and before long a quest was on to find out if Brian Blessed had ever been
in Star Trek...</span></p>
