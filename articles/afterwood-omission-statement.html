<p class=MsoTitle>Afterwood</p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>I’m a big fan of quotes, not the funny little marks we use
to enclose strings in source code and speech in prose, or use inappropriately
when distinguishing between plurals and possession, but those tiny utterances
which are either written or spoken and yet manage to convey much more. One man
who has provided so many of the latter and yet equally suffered from the
malaise of the complex rules of the apostrophe is Fred Brooks. (I constructed
that sentence very carefully to avoid that particular trap and therefore save
valuable time for the editor and reviewers.) From his vast catalogue of
memorable writing I can easily single out one quote which sums up a career in
programming without passing judgement on those who find themselves on the wrong
side of the tracks:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Good judgement comes from experience, and experience comes
from bad judgement.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Relayed in its entirety it stands as a shining example of
how even failure can be seen in a good light – a continuous source of learning
– so long as the culture surrounding us provides us with the safety we need to
experiment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sadly not all quotes have the structure that allows them to
remain intact or at least to withstand the continual need to compress and
distil a concept into as few words as possible. This reductionism works pretty
well in the Design Patterns community where we have managed to reduce many
common solutions to repeating problems in software design down to just a few
words. In the case of the Gang of Four they reached the holy grail of just a single
word for a number of fundamental concepts and gave us the power to communicate
volumes with a ubiquitous language. In time they even gave us the power to
evoke a complex emotional response simply by uttering the word “singleton”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In one of her many (self-confessed) failed attempts to write
an editorial the Overload editor reminded us of those immortal words from
Strunk &amp; White which no doubt play a significant role in the crusade to
eliminate the superfluous – “omit needless words”. Given the prevalence of soot
in the printing process (as an ingredient of ink) you could make an argument
that following this advice would lead you to a reduction in your carbon
footprint too. Fran amusingly points out that with undue care you can take this
too far and quickly lose the essence, creating a monster in its wake. Needless
to say that naively paraphrasing Strunk &amp; White as “omit words” is not a
zero sum game.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I’m sure there are people who feel <i>that</i> famous
six-word story from Ernest Hemingway about unworn baby shoes on eBay <i>can</i>
be improved upon, although that wasn’t it. I’ve definitely been in project
meetings where Kent Beck’s succinct expression of how late you can leave a
decision, namely the “last responsible moment”, has undoubtedly been
irresponsibly re-interpreted as the “last moment”, at which point a mad
scramble takes place to continue to hit the (no doubt artificial) deadline.
From the vitriol that appears regularly on the Internet you could be mistaken
for believing that Beck was also responsible for suggesting that we merely “do
the simplest thing” and forgo any thought or planning (the consequences be
damned). After all, what possible extra value does “...that could possibly
work” add to such a proposition – who would be stupid enough to trade-off “simplicity”
over “working”? Maybe the very same people that would prefer to just “Keep It
Simple” and kiss goodbye to correctness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sir Tony Hoare is definitely no stranger to this phenomenon.
I wonder if our industry’s billion pound mistake is an inability to write
quotes out in full. The poster child for this whole affair is almost certainly
the continued debate around whether or not someone is “prematurely optimising”.
Delivered by itself Hoare may as well have written: “we should forget about
full quotations, say about 97% of the time”. I guess some quotes need to be
made so simple they have no obvious deficiencies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes it feels like there is a Newton’s Third Law of
Truism – for every quotation there is an equal and opposite (misguided)
interpretation. This makes some conversations seem like a game of Quote Trumps™
where you try to make a succinct point and then your colleague feels the need
to respond with a “superior” quote in the hope of scoring more points. For
example “the customer is always right” is almost always “trumped” by that old
classic (which is commonly attributed to Henry Ford) about the customer really
wanting “faster horses”. This quote is almost always used to justify why
developers know better than their customers and therefore give themselves the
right to explore some shiny new technology rather than spend <i>more time</i>
understanding what problem the customer is really trying to solve. Sometimes
the problem is to discover what the problem is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I don’t believe it’s limited to our industry but maybe we’re
just in more of a rush than anyone else and are therefore more content to skip
the research and critical thinking phases and move straight on to the executive
summary. Mind you, <i>that</i> expression is now considered overly verbose too
and has been undercut by the new kid on the block “TL;DR”. How long before we
capture this sentiment within a single emoji and continue to prematurely
optimise reading time over comprehension?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quotations are written for people to read and only
incidentally for inclusion in motivational books (or for comedic effect). The
moment we start to paraphrase we run the risk of subtly changing the meaning in
such a way that our audience will miss the point, with the catastrophic effect
that they may even take away the opposite view to what was intended by the
original author; in the wrong hands quotes could be considered harmful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For those less familiar with Strunk &amp; White they need
look no further than Hoare himself as he was the one who suggested that inside
every large program is a small one struggling to get out. Reductionism is
therefore an essential process but how do we ensure that we make things as
simple as possible, but no simpler? I fear there is no silver bullet...</p>
