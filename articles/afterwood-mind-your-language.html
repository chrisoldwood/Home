<p class=MsoTitle><span lang=EN-US>Afterwood</span></p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>When StackOverflow sprang up way back in
mid-2008 it seemed like a game changer for the industry. Even for someone like me
who had already earned a few stripes as a programmer by struggling with the
craft through the use of product documentation, journals, books, web sites, CIS
&amp; CiX forums, etc. I found much to like about the innovative format as it
promised to raise the signal-to-noise ratio to much higher levels. At that time
I was also making the switch from a career spent entirely in the native world
to the managed one of .NET so felt I would be in a good position to provide
help to those new to the place I was leaving behind while drawing on the
expertise of those already ahead of me on the path to my new destination.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Of course I didn’t reckon on the volume of
people out there who also appeared eager to help out but apparently didn’t need
to either eat or sleep! I was never expecting to reach the dizzying heights of
“reputation” achieved by the likes of StackOverflow’s most famous respondent –
Jon Skeet – but I felt chalking up a few answers would at least give me
something else to raise my profile and give any potential future employers one more
reason to prefer me over someone else.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It’s funny how things work out. It’s now
over 10 years since I joined and yet I’m still to even reach the 1,000 mark.
Consequently it’s rare I visit the site and get a notification saying I’ve
earned some more points or received a comment to one of my answers. Hence when
I visited recently and found a little badge on my inbox I was expecting good
news; I never for a moment expected a comment from someone suggesting that one
of my answers was incredibly condescending and that I was blaming the
questioner for their own predicament.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Being a programmer with a bit of mileage I
probably don’t google things much less frequently than anyone else but years of
skim reading articles, blog posts, and forum messages has meant that I’ve found
it easy to skip over the “noise” and focus on whether or not the answer is
likely to be of interest. As a consequence I’ve become ignorant of the kinds of
problems that have caused a number of people to suggest that Q&amp;A sites like
StackOverflow are not as welcoming or as helpful as they purport to be. Given
their reliance on contributions from the general public, such as myself, that
means some portion of the blame almost certainly lays with the attitudes of us
programmers who have chosen to offer our time and expertise to help others out.
In more recent years I’ve made a conscious effort to try and learn more about
the subtle ways that people denigrate others, so I was unprepared to discover
that <i>I</i> might have ended up on the wrong side of the tracks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It’s all too easy when challenged to go on
the defensive and find ways to brush off the accuser as someone who’s clearly
made no effort to understand what you’ve said and just needs to “get over
themselves”. The somewhat passive-aggressive nature of the comment didn’t
really encourage me to immediately take the issue seriously whereas the
apparent “injustice” did mean I felt the need to investigate further. I
followed the notification which, curiously, had taken 9 months to deliver and
re-read whatever it was I said back in 2010 that had caused offence:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.45pt'><span lang=EN-US>“You don't
mention what language you're using but there is no hidden setting that hides
errors per se, other than the compiler giving up after it has encountered a
gazillion issues (Visual C++). It has decided that there is so much wrong with
the code that it's not going to waste even more time telling you stuff that
you're just going to ignore. Classic examples of this are caused by missing
braces and parenthesis, or botched #include guards etc.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>My gut reaction was that “2010 me” was
probably trying to be light-hearted or sarcastic but “2020 me” was somewhat
appalled that I would have not spotted the obvious potential for
misunderstanding. But it <i>was</i> just a misunderstanding, right? I want to
believe there was no intention of malice on my part – that I was suggesting the
tool was at fault, not the operator – but I also can’t deny that I haven’t
overused sarcasm in the past and stepped over the mark once or twice. My hope
is that while “2010 me” might have been better at judging the mood in person I
clearly still had a lot to learn back then about the written word and personal
responsibility.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Hemingway said that “the only kind of
writing is rewriting” and “2020 me” is beginning to understand that more and
more. While my younger self may have been satisfied to simply avoid spelling
and grammatical mistakes my older self is slowly becoming more aware of the
ways in which language can be used by a writer to insult certain kinds of
reader. I realize it falls on <i>my</i> shoulders to be wise to this and ensure
that if my intent is not to be misinterpreted then I should steer clear of
those devices.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I toyed briefly with deleting my answer as
it turned out in the end to be totally irrelevant to the question and I’m not
entirely sure what I said was even correct. Instead I decided not to hide my
embarrassment and so I rewrote the answer using “2020 me” to keep the gist but
hopefully place the emphasis on the limitations of the tool rather than the
programmer using it. I also added a short apology too to make it clear I was
not hiding anything by rewriting it after the fact. This, I hope, also ensures
the comment calling my answer out as inappropriate does not look out of place
either. And, while a tiny part of me feels their tone was somewhat
inappropriate too, “2020 me” accepts that negativity is not best handled with yet
more negativity, instead I can thank them for giving me the catalyst to review
my past attempt and revise it so that no one else has to feel uncomfortable in
the future.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The question I now find myself asking is if
this was an isolated moment of naivety or do I need to go back and check what
else I’ve written in public, and if so, how far back? The answer, for me, I
feel is “yes”, although I know I’m lucky enough not to have that much to look
over specifically in StackOverflow. I have since found a few of my earlier blog
posts use terms which my current self would never consider appropriate, not
because they are in any way nasty, more that I think I’ve found better terms
that I hope has made my subsequent writing more accessible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I’m in no doubt that feedback from both
friends and reviewers at ACCU over the last 10 years has had a significant
impact in changing my view on the importance of the written word and this
incident continues to confirm my suspicion that whether it be code or prose it
always suffers when I’m left to my own devices.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Chris is a freelance programmer who started
out as a bedroom coder in the 80’s writing assembler on 8-bit micros. These
days it's enterprise grade technology <s>in plush corporate offices</s> from
