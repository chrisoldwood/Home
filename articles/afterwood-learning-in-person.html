<p class=MsoNormal>I don’t know if it was a New Year’s resolution to resurrect
the ACCU Cambridge meetup, but 2025 will start with exactly that happening, as organiser
Phil Nash kicks off the reboot with his own talk about the past, present, and
future state of C++. Now that I’m working remotely practically full-time,
having an ACCU meetup in my neck of the woods is most welcome. A lawyer might
argue that the pre-reboot social at a pub in Cambridge just before Christmas
was the <i>real</i> reboot event, but January sees the actual return of the
traditional format – a talk, book-ended with some socialising / networking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ACCU Cambridge meetup holds a special place in my heart
as it was the first meetup I ever attended. Way back in late 2007 (not long
after I joined ACCU) Jez Higgins gave an amusingly titled talk <i>Iteration:
It's just one damn thing after another</i>. Up until that point my only real
sources of learning about the craft of programming were books, dedicated
printed magazines such as Dr Dobbs, C++ Report, MSJ, etc. and – increasingly –
articles on the Internet, such as the Artima Weblogs (sic).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Whichever way you look at it, it was all about the written
word – a very solitary and passive experience. Sure, I talked with colleagues
in the office, and we shared views on the best written content we came across, though
primarily when it had practical implications for the kinds of systems we were
building. When you’re young and all working for the same company for a long
time it can create a form of echo chamber. Unless fresh blood joins the ranks
and brings in experiences from farther afield – other cultures and industries –
there is a danger of groupthink setting in, which is neither optimal for the
employer or employee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It would be easy to go along to the meetup, listen to the
presentation, and then leave; all without saying a word to anyone else. But
then this would be no different to reading the transcript or watching the video
later (not that that was really even an option back then). What I found most
enjoyable from that meetup experience was the interactivity, both with the
speaker and the other attendees. Being Cambridge there were a number of people
from the embedded arena, a sector with very different constraints to those I’d personally
experienced in a professional capacity. (Writing assembly language in your
bedroom as a teenager might give you some technical empathy but does not
prepare you for the commercial pressures of real-world software development.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One consequence of <i>that</i> experience, and those meetups
which followed, was that I attended my first ACCU Conference the following year
in 2008. This was almost like back-to-back meetups, but where you also shared breakfast,
lunch, and dinner with the other attendees too. I didn’t write a review of my
2008 conference experience, mostly because I wasn’t into writing back then (in
fact I abhorred it). However Steve Love (amongst others), clearly helped me
overcome my shyness a year later and I concluded my 2009 ACCU Conference review
for C Vu with “I know it’s only my second year, but it lost none of the magic I
experienced last year.” Words to that effect appear to be my closing remark on my
five subsequent ACCU conference reviews for C VU too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Over 15 years later and I still find attending meetups and
conferences a hugely enjoyable part of my learning process, whether hosted by
ACCU or otherwise. Conferences in particular have provided a level of diversity
of content that I might not have been exposed to if each session had been a
separate article, book, or meetup to attend. A conference allows you to
leverage the locality of reference and amortise the cost of each session across
the whole event making it cheaper to step outside your comfort zone and attend
talks which may not directly influence your current role, but could well
contribute to your overall well-roundedness as a programmer. On some occasions
an over-subscribed talk forced me to seek refuge elsewhere and I have
subsequently been enlightened by a topic I didn’t even know existed. I’ve never
written a line of Scala, Clojure, Ruby, Lisp, or Haskell in my life, either
professionally or for fun, but spending 45 to 90 minutes watching a talk on
them moved those subjects (and related concepts) from the level of “unconscious
incompetence” to “conscious incompetence&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Naturally, The Four Stages of Competence is a learning model
I first heard about through a meetup, and the meta subject of “learning about
learning” usually makes one or two appearances at meetups and conferences that cover
a wider spectrum of programming topics than one focusing on a single technology.
While I remember soaking up everything I could about C++ during those first few
ACCU conferences (because it was my bread-and-butter) I purposefully attended
talks about testing, databases, system’s thinking, requirements analysis,
architecture, etc. to help add colour to the craft that I knew I’d probably
have to embrace anyway at some point in my career, even if I wanted to remain a
hands-on software developer. (Conference keynotes can fill this void to some
extent too, when used effectively, but it’s becoming more common for them to
remain technical, which I believe is a lost opportunity.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For most of us collaboration plays a significant role in our
daily lives, and being able to communicate ideas well to a variety of
stakeholders, whether they be customers, management, operations, testers,
fellow developers, etc. makes us more productive if we can anticipate their
problems ahead of time – to some degree – because we have an appreciation for
their discipline too. Socialising with other people in a dedicated learning
environment allows you to explore that without the pressure of the business setting
biasing the conversation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even if you do choose to stick with what you know best and only
attend events for your technology stack of choice, you’ll still be greeted with
an endless supply of interactive programming war stories to prepare you for the
future, ones that you’d rarely get from reading incident post mortems or The
Daily WTF. Plus, meeting some of your favourite authors and contributors can do
wonders for confronting your Imposter Syndrome as you realise they’re all mere
mortals and don’t in fact know everything there is to know about everything.</p>
