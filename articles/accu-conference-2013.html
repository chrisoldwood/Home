<h1 align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>ACCU Conference
2013</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It’s April once again and that can only
mean one thing – apart from the school holidays and Easter eggs – it’s the ACCU
Conference. This year saw one of the biggest changes to the conference – a new
venue. And not just a new hotel but in a <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">new
  city</st1:City></st1:place> too! For the last 5 years I’ve only ever been to
the same hotel in <st1:City w:st="on">Oxford</st1:City> and so with much
trepidation I headed down to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Bristol</st1:City></st1:place>.
One of my biggest “worries” was what was going to replace all those long
standing traditions, like “Chutneys Tuesday”? But hey, we’re all agile these
days so we should embrace change, right?</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Wednesday</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Once again I didn’t get to partake in one
of the tutorial days on the Tuesday which was a shame as they looked excellent
as usual. Instead I made my way down on the Wednesday and arrived in the early
afternoon. That meant I missed lunch, but also more importantly the keynote
from Eben Upton about the Raspberry Pi and a talk from Jonathan Wakely about
SFINAE. The comments coming through on Twitter about these, and the other parallel
talks, generated much gnashing of teeth as I cursed my late arrival.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Not wanting to take things lightly I dived
head-first into Johan Herland’s session about Git. I’ve done a little messing
around with Git and have read the older 1<sup>st</sup> edition O’Reilly book
but I wasn’t sure whether I’d really understood it. Luckily Johan walked us slowly
through how Git works in theory, and then in practice. I’m glad I saw this as
it seems I was on the right track but he explained some things much better than
the book. I also got to quiz him in the bar later about how some Subversion
concepts might translate to Git, or not as it seems, which was priceless.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Next up, was <st1:PersonName w:st="on">Pete
 Goodliffe</st1:PersonName> doing the live version of his C Vu column on
Becoming a Better Programmer. This was split into two parts with the first
being Pete discussing what we even mean by “better”. He provided some of his
thoughts and there were the usual array of highly entertaining slides to back
them up – you are always guaranteed a good show. The second part was provided
by various speakers (chosen by Pete) who got to spend 5 or so minutes
discussing a topic that they believe makes them a better programmer.
Unsurprisingly these varied greatly from the practical, such as Automation (<st1:PersonName
w:st="on">Steve Love</st1:PersonName>), to the more philosophical – The Music
of Programming (Didier Verna). The audience got to have a quick vote on what
they felt was the most useful and Seb Rose’s Deliberate Practice got the nod.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Once the main sessions have finished for the
day the floor is opened up to everyone in the guise of Lightning Talks. These
are short 5 minute affairs where anyone can let off steam, share a tip or plug
something (non-commercial). Even though it was only the first evening there was
a full program with talks about such topics as Design Sins (<st1:PersonName
w:st="on">Pete Goodliffe</st1:PersonName>), C++ Active Objects (Calum Grant),
BDD with Boost Test (Guy Bolton King), Communities (Didier Verna) and an
attempt at Just a Minute from Burkhard Kloss. With 12 talks in total it was a
good start.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Although not directly part of the ACCU
conference, the Bristol &amp; Bath Scrum Group held an evening event afterwards
where James Grenning talked about TDD. Although it had been a long day already
I couldn’t resist squeezing one more talk in, especially from someone like this.
Being aimed at a wider audience than just developers meant there were an
interesting assortment of questions afterwards which was useful. One in
particular was the common question of writing the test first versus immediately
after which always causes a interesting debate.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Thursday</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>A full English breakfast and plenty coffee
set me up for the day and I was greeted with my first 2013 keynote, courtesy of
Brian Marick. He started with an interesting tangent about crickets and how
they tune into a mate and eventually got onto the topic of how to cope with the
inevitable natural decay older programmers will suffer from. The thing that has
stuck with me most is the advice of converting “goal attainment” to “maintaining
invariants”. This he explained by showing how a baseball fielder might try to
catch a ball by moving himself so he sees a linear trajectory rather than
trying to anticipate a parabolic path. This was one of the most enjoyable
keynotes I’ve seen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I didn’t have much choice in what I went to
after Brian as it was might turn to step up to the plate. This was my third
year of speaking and I’d like to say I might finally be getting the hang of it.
At least, I don’t think anyone fell asleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Unbeknownst to me until I checked my
Twitter feed afterwards but there was a small bug in the code on one of my
slides. This made my next choice easy – The Art of Reviewing Code with Arjan
van Leeuwen. There was plenty of sound advice here, particularly around the
area of getting started in code reviews where it’s important to make both
parties comfortable to avoid a sense of personal attack. As Ajan pointed out,
time is often the perceived barrier to doing reviews, but it’s reminded me how valuable
it can be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>That was only a short session and the other
45 minutes I spent with <st1:PersonName w:st="on">Ewan Milne</st1:PersonName> as
he discussed Agile Contracts. Although I don’t get involved (yet?) in that side
of the process I still find it useful to comprehend the other parts of an agile
approach. Understanding how the different forms of contract attempt to transfer
the risk from one side to the other was enlightening – especially when you
consider the role lawyers try to play in the process. Ewan normally has his
hands full with organising the lightning talks so it was good to see him speak
for longer than 30 seconds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>My final session for the day was to be
spent with Michel Grootjans. With a title of Ruby and Rails for n00bs I felt
that suited my knowledge of Ruby right down to the ground and hoped I would get
to see what some of the fuss is about. It actually turned out to be way more
useful than I expected because Michel developed a simple web app using a
full-on TDD approach too. Not only did I get a small taste for what Ruby and
Rails is about but I also saw someone develop a different sort of application
using different tools in a more enterprise-y way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Once more, after the main sessions had
completed, most of us convened to the main hall to listen to another round of
lightning talks. This time there was a total of 13 topics with an even wider
range than the day before. Notably for me, given my attendance at an earlier
session on Git, was a rant from Charles Bailey about Git being evil. There were
also complaints about poor variable naming (Simon Sebright) and why anyone
would use C++ when D exists (Russel Winder, naturally). On the more useful
front we saw Dmitry Kandalov implement an Eclipse plug-in in 5 minutes and a
C++ technique that seems close to C#’s async/await mechanism (Stig Sandnes). The
abusive C++ award though goes to Phil Nash with his &lt;- operator for implementing
extension methods. Oh, and Anders Schau Knatten used “Science” to help us
decide that C# is in fact the best programming language.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Friday</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>What better start to the day than a keynote
from the very person we have to thank for C++ - Bjarne Stroustrup. It’s been
some years since he graced the ACCU conference with his presence and so like
many I was looking forward to what he had to say about the modern state of C++.
His presentation was generally about the new features we now have in C++ 11 as
he had a separate session planned for C++ 14. However there was as much about
how the established practices (e.g. RAII) are still the dominant force and
critical to its effectiveness. Naturally there were plenty of questions and he
pulled no punches when airing his opinion on the relationship between C and
C++.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>With my C++ side ignited I felt it was only
right that I attend Nico Josuttis’ talk about move semantics and how that plays
with the exception safety guarantee of a function like push_back(). He entered the
murkier depths of C++ to show how complex this issue is for those who produce
C++ libraries. When someone like Nico says C++ is getting “a little scary” you
know you need to pay attention. My “moment of the conference” happened here
when, in response to a question for Nico about the std::pair class, Jonathon
Wakely instantly rattled off the C++ standard section number to help him find
the right page…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>We all love writing fresh, new code, but
many of us spend our lives wallowing in the source code left to us by others. Cleaning
Code by Mike Long was a session that showed you why refactoring is important
and what some of the tools and techniques you can use to help in the fight
against entropy. This was a very well attended talk and rightly so with a good mix
of the theoretical and practical. One tool in particular for finding duplicate
code certainly looked sexy and will definitely be getting a spin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>After another round of coffee I decided to
close the day off by listening to the C Vu editor (<st1:PersonName w:st="on">Steve
 Love</st1:PersonName>) explain why C# is such as Doddle to learn and use. Yes,
his tongue very firmly placed in his cheek. As someone who uses C# for a living
it's easy to forget certain things that you take for granted with something
like C++, such as the complexity guarantees of the core containers. Generics
also came in for a bit of a bashing as a watered down version of templates. Anyone
who thinks the world of C# is dragon free would have done well to attend.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The final set of lightning talks took their
cue from the volcano fiasco a few years ago. Back then, due to speaker problems
caused by a lack of air transport, a set of 15 minute lightning keynotes were put
together instead and that’s the length these ones adopted. Seb Rose opened the
proceedings with a response to an earlier lightning talk about whether the term
“passionate” is a useful one for describing the kind of people we want to work
with, given its dictionary definition. Much nodding of heads suggested he was probably
right. He was followed by me trying to show how many of the old texts, such as
the papers by David Parnas, are still largely relevant today. And, more
importantly they’re often cheap. Tom Gilb was next up to answer a question I
had posed in my talk about quantifying robustness. Let’s face it, we knew he
would. Finally Didier Verna got to extend his earlier slot on The <st1:PersonName
w:st="on">Pete Goodliffe</st1:PersonName> Show to go into more detail about the
similarities he sees between music and programming. I’ve never really given
Jazz a second thought before, and even though we only got a 30 second burst of
his own composition my interest is definitely piqued.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The Friday evening always plays host to The
Conference Dinner, which is a sort of banquet where we get to spend a little
more time mingling with the various speakers and attendees. This is a perfect
opportunity to corner a speaker and ask some questions you didn’t get a chance
to earlier. Jon made sure the tables regularly got mixed up to keep the flow of
people moving between courses which helps you mix with people you might not normally
know. After the dinner there was the Bloomberg Lounge to keep us entertained
through the night, if you fancied staying up until silly o’clock.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Saturday</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There was another change to the session structure
this year as the Saturday keynote was moved to the end of the day; instead the
normal sessions started earlier. Sadly I overdid the conference dinner again
and so an early start was never really on the cards.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>How to Program Your Way Out of a Paper Bag
seemed like the ideal eventual start to the day. <st1:PersonName w:st="on">Frances
 Buontempo</st1:PersonName> had sold the idea well – is it possible to actually
write a program to get out of a paper bag? Obviously there was a certain amount
of artistic licence, but ultimately she did it, and along the way we got to
find out a whole lot about machine learning. I was a little worried there might
be a bit too much maths at that time of day but it was well within even my meagre
reach.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>My final session of the conference was to
be with Hubert Matthews - A History of a Cache. This was a case study of some
work he been involved in. The session had a wonderful narrative as he started
by explaining how the system was originally designed, and then went on to drop
the bomb on how he needed to find a huge performance boost with the usual array
of “impossible” constraints. Each suggested improvement brought about a small
win, but not enough by itself and that’s what made it entertaining. It also
goes to show what can be achieved sometimes without going through a rewrite.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Epilogue</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I keep expecting the magic of this
conference to wear off, but so far it seems to be holding fast. I have looked
around at some of the other conferences but I’m just not as impressed by the
content or the price for that matter. I thought the new venue worked well and
even though it was a little further to travel it wasn’t exactly onerous. More
of the talks were filmed this year and so hopefully I should be able to catch up
on some of those I missed. With 5 concurrent sessions running in each time slot
you’re never going to get to see everything you want to, but that’s just
another reason to keep coming back year-after-year – to try and catch up on
everything you’ve missed in previous years. Of course in the meantime the world
has moved on and there’s another load of new stuff to see and learn!</span></p>
