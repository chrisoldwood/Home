<p class=MsoTitle><a name="OLE_LINK2"></a><a name="OLE_LINK1">In The Toolbox – Finding
Text</a></p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>It started with a fairly simple question: &quot;Do you know
of anything that can open a 400 MB text file?&quot; Whilst being new to the
team I've been programming professionally long enough to know that this isn't
the real question. I have my suspicions about what my fellow programmer really
wants to do but I need to ask them what this huge text file is and, more
importantly, why are they trying to <i>open</i> this file in the first place?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My hunch is correct – it was a log file. And the reason they
are trying to open it is because they are on support and what to understand why
something is failing or misbehaving. Hence the real problem is about how to
efficiently view and manipulate large text-based log files. On Windows the
lowest common denominator for this is <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>more</span>,
if using the command line, and <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>Notepad</span>
for the GUI-oriented. The latter is essentially just a wrapper around the Windows
edit-box control and was never designed for handling large chunks of text.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After quickly reeling off close to a dozen tools that I <i>could</i>
use to view and process log files it got me thinking about the wider question:
what tools might I use to solve the more general problem of &quot;finding
text&quot;, and what conditions or constraints would cause me to choose one
over another? After all, this task is one that we programmers probably perform
many, many times a day for different reasons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The criteria for this list are pedagogically loose and cover
the need to match prose and structured text, both programmatically and also
manually. When diagnosing a problem we often don't know what the pattern is at
that point and so we have to rely on our built-in pattern recognition system to
seek out some semblance of order from the chaos. At which point we may switch
or combine approaches to delve in further. In some cases we may not even be
consciously looking for it, but the tool makes it apparent and leads us to go
looking for more anomalies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This list of tools is not, and cannot be comprehensive
because the very problem itself is being solved again and again. It is also not
presented it any particular order because the tool might be used in a variety
of contexts depending on the conditions and constraints in play. Many of these
tools do have very similar variations though and are pretty much
interchangeable so are discussed together.</p>

<h1>FIND / FINDSTR</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Windows comes with not one, but two command line tools for
finding text within files (or the standard input). If you want to know why
there are two similar tools you can read Raymond Chen's blog post [RC], but in
short they come from the two different Windows lineages – 9x and NT.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I rarely use <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>FIND</span>,
except by accident, as it has the same name as one of the classic UNIX command
line tools which does something different. Luckily the more recent Gnu on
Windows (GoW) distributions [Gow] have taken the pragmatic approach of renaming
its <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>FIND</span> tool to <span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>GFIND</span> to avoid surprises when running
scripts where the <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>PATH</span> order
differs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even without this wrinkle there is little reason to use <span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>FIND</span> over <span style='font-family:
"Courier New"'>FINDSTR</span> as the latter has some support for regular
expressions. Sadly it also has this weird behaviour of treating a string with
spaces as a list of words to match instead of treating the entire string
literally.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Given its general non-standard behaviour, with respect to <span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>GREP</span> (and its cousins), it might seem
somewhat useless. But it has two things going for it – it's installed by
default and is fast in comparison to some other similar command line tools I've
used.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was a time when production servers where tightly locked
down and so this was your only option. Operations teams seem to be a little
more open these days to a wider variety of tools, no doubt in part due to the
use of VMs to isolate applications, and therefore teams, from each other.</p>

<h1>GREP / EGREP / FGREP</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>The natural alterative to the Windows <span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>FIND</span>/<span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>FINDSTR</span>
combination is the UNIX equivalent <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>GREP</span>.
It has two counterparts <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>EGREP</span>
and <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>FGREP</span> which are really just
short-hands for <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>GREP –E</span> and <span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>GREP –F</span> respectively. In fact the <span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>--help</span> switch for the short-hands
warns you they are deprecated forms. Sadly my muscle memory keeps kicking in as
I've been using ports of them since my days working on DOS.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the record the difference is that <span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>EGREP</span> (<span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>GREP
–E</span>) enables an extended regular expression syntax whilst <span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>FGREP</span> (<span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>GREP
–F</span>) treats the strings literally and so (I guess) is faster. I haven't
timed them recently and suspect that there is little in it these days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For a long time I used the Win32 ports distributed as
UnxUtils, but that went stale years ago and GoW (Gnu on Windows) has replaced
it as my port of choice as it has no extra dependencies, such as Cygwin. As
such it makes it easy to include these in a diagnostics package or just <span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>XCOPY</span> them about. What makes
Operations feel uneasy is software that needs &quot;installing&quot; whereas
being able to run something directly from a remote file share usually won't
raise their ire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With the introduction of the Chocolately package manager [CPM]
on Window this toolset is pretty much one of the first things I install, and
the renaming of <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>FIND</span> to <span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>GFIND</span> now makes it safer to install on
a server too without fear of silently breaking something else.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Like many others this is the tool I probably reach for
first, command-line wise.</p>

<h1>AWK &amp; SED</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the task is to simply find <i>some</i> text then <span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>GREP</span> pretty much does the trick, but
often I'm looking to do a little bit more. I might need to do a little parsing,
such as summing numbers contained within it or transforming it slightly to
reduce the noise. In these cases I'm once again looking to the UNIX toolset
classics, this time <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>AWK</span> and <span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>SED</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I had forgotten about them for many years whilst I was
heavily into doing front-end work, but as I switched to the back-end again I
found myself doing a lot more text processing. In fact I wrote about my
rediscovery in these very pages a few years ago [AS].</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Whilst I <i>could</i> use <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>SED</span>
more often as a replacement for <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>GREP</span>
I keep forgetting the differences in the regular expression syntax (there are
many things it doesn't support) and so I find myself wasting time trying to
debug the regex only to discover I'm using an <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>EGREP</span>
supported construct. Hence I usually carry around a copy of the O'Reilly pocket
reference books on regular expressions and <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>SED</span>
&amp; <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>AWK</span>, mostly for the tables
comparing support across <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>SED</span>, <span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>GREP</span> and <span style='font-family:
"Courier New"'>AWK</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I could use <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>AWK</span>
far more than I do for basic text matching because it's pretty quick, but I
forget and only remember when I suddenly realize I need the power of its
formatting options, not its matching ones.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One particularly useful feature of <span style='font-family:
"Courier New"'>SED</span> and <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>AWK</span>
is their support for address ranges. If you have some pretty-printed XML or
JSON (i.e. one tag or key/value pair per line) then you can match parts of the
document using address ranges. For example, before I discovered <span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>JQ</span> for querying JSON [JQ], I generated
some simple release notes by extracting the card number and title from a Trello
board exported as JSON via a script I wrote that invoked <span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>SED</span> and <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>AWK</span>.</p>

<h1>MORE / HEAD</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Earlier I mentioned that I often rely heavily on my own
human pattern matching skills to home in something hopefully buried within the
chaos. If I'm already in the process of building a pipeline to do some matching
I might just want to pass my eye over the content by paging through it and
seeing if any patterns emerge in the flicker. Hence <span style='font-family:
"Courier New"'>MORE</span> (or <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>HEAD</span>
if I remember it's there) are useful ways to page text for manual scanning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I generally shy away from using <span style='font-family:
"Courier New"'>HEAD</span> though as the versions in the UnxUtils and GoW
distributions often go bonkers complaining about a broken pipe and it quickly
floods the screen with an error. I'm sure I'm just doing something wrong but it
hasn't bothered me enough to discover what it is. That's the great thing about
have so many choices, you just work around the limitations in one tool by
picking another similar one.</p>

<h1>PowerShell</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>In more recent years as I've started to use PowerShell more
and more for scripting I naturally find myself becoming more comfortable using
the built-in features of the language to create even simple text processing
pipelines as well as its more powerful <i>object</i> base ones.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In particular the language comes with some useful cmdlets
out-of-the-box for handling XML and CSV files in a more structured way. For
example you can import a CSV file and name the columns (if it's not already
done via a header row) which then allows you to query the data using the more
natural column names instead of, say, using <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>CUT</span>
and having to refer to them numerically. This really aids readability in
wrapper scripts too [WS].</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Whilst PowerShell comes with great flexibility by using .Net
for its underpinnings, this also comes at a cost. The performance of parsing
textual log files is considerably worse than with native code, such as <span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>AWK</span>. I once needed to do some analysis
that involved parsing many multi-megabyte log files on a remote share. I started
out using PowerShell but eventually discovered it was taking a couple of
minutes just to read a file. So I switched to <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>AWK</span>
instead which managed to read and parse the same file in only 8 seconds. This
was on PowerShell v2 and so more recent versions of .Net and PowerShell may
well have closed the gap.</p>

<h1>LogParser</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another very old, free tool that I've found useful for
parsing log files because of its performance is Microsoft's <span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>LogParser</span> [LP]. Originally written to
parse IIS log files it grew the ability to read various other text and binary format
files which, like the <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>Import-Csv</span>
cmdlet in PowerShell, can give the data's columns names. These can then be used
within <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>LogParser</span>'s SQL-like
language to create some pretty powerful queries.</p>

<h1>BareTail</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the ways I've found to help the mind unearth patterns
in text, again especially when dealing with analysing log files is to apply a
dash of colour to certain lines and words. Just as I use syntax highlighting to
make source code a little easier to read, I apply the same principle to other
kinds of files. For example I'll highlight error messages in red and warnings
in yellow. If there are regular lines that are usually of little interest, such
as a server heartbeat message, I'll colour it in light grey so that it blends
into the white background to make the more significant behaviour (in black) stand-out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first decent Windows tool I found that did this was a
commercial tool (with a free cut-down version) called <span style='font-family:
"Courier New"'>BareTail</span>. Naturally others have sprung up in the meantime,
like <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>LogExpert</span>, which are free.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What really attracted me to shell out for the full version
was its ability to tail a file and at the bottom have a real-time <span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>GREP</span> running over the same file to
filter out interesting events. This was a feature my previous team had built
into its own custom log viewer years before and so was a most welcome discovery.</p>

<h1>BareGrep</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>The sister tool to <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>BareTail</span>
is called <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>BareGrep</span>, which is a
GUI based version of the old classic described earlier. It too has the same
highlighting support and also has a <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>TAIL</span>
like view at the bottom which provides additional context around the lines you
match with the pattern in the main view.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The two other features that made it a worthy addition to my
toolbox were its ability to use regular expressions on the filename matching
(rather than the usual simpler file globbing provided by the Windows <span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>FindFirstFile</span> API), and its support
for naming and saving patterns. On support I often find myself using the same
regex patterns again and again to pick out certain interesting events at the
start of an investigation.</p>

<h1>Notepad</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>This article began by explaining what the alternatives are
on Windows to the simplistic Notepad, but that doesn’t mean it's not still
useful. Aside from WordPad it's the only GUI based viewer installed by default
which might be significant in a locked down environment. Even so it can still
be handy for smaller stuff, like looking at <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>.config</span>
files.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a way its naivety is also one of its few useful traits.
By only handling Windows line endings and having an insane tab width setting of
8 means that any screwy formatting shows up pretty quickly and acts as a gentle
reminder to check everyone's on the same page editor-configuration wise.</p>

<h1>Notepad++</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>The original <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>Notepad</span>
is very much a tool of last resort and so I'll try and install something a
little more powerful as a replacement for day-to-day, non-IDE based text
editing jobs, such as writing mark-up. It's quick to open and provides all the
usual features you'd expect from a plug-in enhanced text editor. It could
easily be Atom, Sublime Text or any one of a number of decent editors out
there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For me the decision to use the command line or a GUI based
tool when searching for text depends on how much context I need when I find
what I'm looking for and also whether I'm going to edit it afterwards. When
searching log files it's ultimately a read-only affair with perhaps some
statistical output. In contrast a document probably means I'm going to select
some text and paste it elsewhere or even edit the prose in-situ which demands
at least a spell checker.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The other factor is often whether I've navigated to the data
via a command prompt or the Windows Explorer in which case a right-click is easier
than opening a prompt at the folder and typing a command. That said if the file
type association is already registered it's just as easy to go the other route
and open it in a GUI tool from the command line. And sometimes the choice of
tool is totally arbitrary and depends on whatever I've not used in a while and feel
I need to remind myself about.</p>

<h1>Visual Studio</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Anyone who has ever double-clicked the Visual Studio icon by
accident or forgotten to register a more lightweight choice of editor for the
file association will curse their mistake as it takes an eternity to start. But
if it's already running, and being an IDE means it's quite likely for that to
be the case, it's just as easy to reuse it as spawn another text editor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As of Visual Studio 2013 they have also replaced the
byzantine regular expression syntax with the more standard .Net one which makes
finding text with regexes way more palatable. And the new, cross platform
Visual Studio Code editor is looking like this mistake will be far less costly
in future.</p>

<h1>Vendor Specific Tools</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although most content is becoming more available in simpler
text formats so that the choice of tooling is much wider and freer there is
still plenty of it stored in custom binary formats like old MS Word documents.
The rise of wikis and the various flavours of mark-up have certainly gained in
popularity but the enterprise is often locked into vendors through these
bespoke formats and so for completeness these need to be accounted for, but are
on the decline.</p>

<h1>Google</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>The discussion thus far has largely been about finding text
in files on my machine or the intranet. But every day like so many other people
I spend plenty of time looking things up on the Internet and for that,
naturally, I'll use one of the major search engines.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Despite them selling appliances though for well over a decade
that promises to bring the power of an Internet search to the enterprise this
still does not appear to have happened and finding anything on an intranet
still appears to be a fruitless exercise.</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Searching text, whether it be source code, prose, log or
data files is a bread-and-butter activity for programmers. What we do with it
when we've found it adds another dimension to the type of tools we use because
it may not just be plain text we're lifting but we might want the formatting
too. Throw performance and differing query languages into the mix and it's no
wonder that we have to keep our hands on such a varied array of tools.</p>
