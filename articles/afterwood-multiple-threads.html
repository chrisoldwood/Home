<p class=MsoTitle>Afterwood</p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was recently watching an episode of Marvel’s Agents of
S.H.I.E.L.D with my youngest before his bedtime. In the episode they had travelled
back in time to 1940’s America and were changing into clothes considered more appropriate
for the times, to blend in. After they all got changed and met back up again one
character remarked to the other “nice threads!” In this instance they were
referring to another person’s clothes, but it got me thinking that nobody has
ever said that to me, which, given my weak fashion skills is not surprising,
but more topically for this publication, it’s not a phrase I’ve ever heard somebody
remark about another person’s code either. Given the problems that all too often
arise from the introduction of additional threads into a program it’s far more likely
that you’ll be chastised for your threads rather than commended for them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The late Rusel Winder was a programmer who was no stranger
to problems involving concurrency and had the good fortune to work with some
serious parallel hardware when some of use were still all gooey eyed over the <i>second</i>
CPU in our desktop machine. I’m pretty sure Russel would never congratulate anyone
on their choice of threads as he was a big proponent of solving concurrency problems
by using higher-level concepts. Like so much in the world of Computer Science many
of the techniques for managing concurrency have been around for decades and
Russel was always keen to promote the Actor Model, Communicating Sequential
Processes (CSP), etc. in his talks and writings. I never really grokked either
of these until Russel published his <i>Introduction to GPars</i> in C Vu 22(6) back
in 2011. I’ve still never written a line of Groovy or done anything significant
on the JVM but this article provided the clarity I needed to start seeing how
these ideas were realized in a modern language.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you grew up in the UK during the 1980’s you might already
have an aversion to threads due to the BBC’s film of the same name which depicted
the state of Britain after a nuclear war. I was slightly too young to watch it
first time around, although like any teenager that didn’t stop me trying to
because apparently there were “other kids” in our school who had allegedly watched
it. Despite the grown-ups slapping a 15 certificate on it to advise us youngsters
against being foolish and dabbling in issues we were emotionally under equipped
to deal with we jumped right in anyway and regretted it later. Why do we never listen
to our elders? As the old joke goes “some programmers, when confronted with a problem,
think ‘I’ll use threads’, now problems two have they.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I once interviewed someone for a highly technical role and casually
asked them how they felt about lock-free programming. They simply replied, “I’ll
give anything a go.” While I admire their positive outlook on life this was not
really the response I was expecting. Anthony Williams’ book on concurrency with
C++ weighs in at six hundred pages and Joe Duffy’s concurrency book for Windows
hits nine hundred. What this tells me is that it isn’t something you can “dabble
in”, it feels more like a career in its own right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Debugging multi-threaded programs is always an interesting prospect,
especially trying to single step through functions which are executing similar workloads
on different threads. It reminds me of my first foray into the Usenet way back at
university before the common availability of “threaded newsreaders”. Contrary
to what you might be thinking these weren’t programs which used multiple threads
to achieve better UI responsiveness (we’re talking Unix terminals here), this
was about stitching together a continuous stream of forum posts on different topics
so that you could focus on one conversation at a time instead of constantly context
switching between subjects. Single stepping through a multi-threaded program is
always a bit of a shot in the dark as you wonder how far you’ll get before you’re
whisked away to another land. At least we eventually get to return to where we
left off unlike poor old Sam Beckett in Quantum Leap. “Oh, boy!” indeed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It wasn’t just late 80’s newsreaders though, this was also how
Twitter felt in its early years. Fortunately, everything was largely unrelated anyway
so there wasn’t really a context to be dragged away from and return to. The
introduction of the 280 character limit in late 2017 was swiftly followed by
the appearance of “threads” as Twitter tried to convince its users that brevity
was no longer the soul of wit. Further correlation between social media platforms
and concurrent programming are possible when you consider their problems with
coherence and false sharing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One career that seems to have died out since the C++
committee finally decided to come clean with C++11 and define a thread aware memory
model is that of answering Stack Overflow questions about how to safely implement
a Double-Checked Lock (DCL). The Internet was awash with solutions on how to safely
acquire a Singleton (though, once again, you now have two problems) that turned
out to be wrong. The dominance at the time of the Intel CPU meant that “works
on my machine” was almost a statistically valid argument. A few people working on
more advanced CPU architectures got bitten but the strong view taken by the incumbent
x86 meant that many of us lived in ignorant bliss. When Herb Sutter declared to
the world that the free lunch was over, he was talking about CPU single core performance,
but he might as well have been talking about the rise of the ARM which has a
weaker view on ordering and a stronger view on messing with your head. Java had
its DCL crisis just after Y2K calmed down whereas .Net had another decade to go
before its bubble finally burst, even the JVM &amp; CLR are not immune it seems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With the continued working from home and decline of the suit
&amp; tie in the workplace I suspect my chances for a fashion compliment have
long since passed. As for the prospect of never having to deal with a threading
issue again, all I can say is “promises, promises!”</p>

<h3>Biography</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chris is a freelance programmer who started out as a bedroom
coder in the 80’s writing assembler on 8-bit micros. These days it's enterprise
grade technology <s>in plush corporate offices</s> from the comfort of his
breakfast bar. He has resumed commentating on the Godmanchester duck race but
continues to be easily distracted by messages to gort@cix.co.uk and
@chrisoldwood.</p>
