<p class=MsoTitle><span lang=EN-GB>The 2010 ACCU Conference</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>My third visit to the annual ACCU
Conference at the Oxford Barceló Hotel started in pretty much the same way as
the previous two with a late night in the bar catching up with old friends. I
also got to associate a few new faces to some of those email addresses that pop
up on accu-general. The one person I didn’t expect to keep bumping into at the
bar on the first night though was Pete Goodliffe because he was presenting the
following day – in the morning…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The conference opened with a keynote by
Jeff Sutherland who had also been running a Certified Scrum Master course
during the previous two Tutorial days. Fortunately I had seen him speak at JP
Morgan in May last year for the ACCU London branch so I took the opportunity to
nurse my hangover instead. His argument for Scrum and Hyper-Productivity seemed
just as compelling though second time around.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>After the much needed morning coffee break
I headed off to see Anthony Williams talk about Concurrency in the Real World. Given
his pedigree this was a popular session and focused on the new threading features
in the upcoming C++ standard. Having followed his blog I was largely familiar
with the topic, but it was still useful to get all this straight from the
horses mouth in one session. Plus there were a few interesting questions about
how all this gels with CPU &amp; I/O bound tasks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The gremlins that marred lunchtimes last
year seemed to have been laid to rest so I had plenty of time before an early afternoon
session with Guy Bolton King on CouchDB. He started with a little background
about the whole NOSQL movement (Not Only SQL) before moving onto one of the
players – CouchDB. This is a reliable and scalable <span class=GramE>document</span>
style database written in Erlang. He went into a reasonable amount of depth of
the internal architecture which helped you understand how it achieves its
reliability and at what cost. He then used some simple JSON format documents
and JavaScript Map/Reduce functions to give you a feel for how easily you can
build and query views. There was also enough time to cover replication and
partitioning to give a pretty good overview of how this could slot into the
existing <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Enterprise</st1:City></st1:place>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>A spot of afternoon coffee was followed by
a session from Roy Osherove on what makes good teams and team leaders. Once
again, as a follower of his blog it was good to hear him in person. It started
with plenty of personal experience from both the developer and team leader perspectives
to give some useful advice about managing software developers. There were definitely
plenty of nodding heads and agreeable murmurs from the audience. The second
half looked at the tools and techniques used by teams to produce quality
software such as Continuous Integration. Consequently, as a developer, I found
this half of far more interest and a verification that I’m heading in the right
direction. Personally I found the team leading advice somewhat idealistic, but
that probably says far more about the teams I work in than <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">Roy</st1:City></st1:place>’s abilities as a leader. Somewhat
unusually he finished with song about one of his earlier tales that added some novel
light relief.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Thursday morning started with a keynote
from James Bach about testing. It’s been an incredibly long time since I’ve
worked with dedicated testers and his talk reminded me why they are valuable in
their own right. He was at pains to point out that testing is not a stepping
stone to development, but a first class activity that requires a different
mindset. One memorable quote is that “testers don’t break code – developers
do”. He’s a charismatic and energetic speaker which made him a real pleasure to
listen to. His opening video was a brilliant segment of “The Towering Inferno”
with subtitles for the Steve McQueen/Paul Newman roles to relate to the world
of software development. In his blurb he suggested that he’d like to have
converted a few programmers to testers by the end of his talk. I’m sure the ACCU
audience is a little too hardcore for that, but I certainly felt far more
invigorated about testing as a result.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>My first session of the day was from Steve
Love and I’m not even going to try and repeat the title here. This was another
one of Steve’s insightful presentations about good design. He reminds you of
all the balls you need to keep juggling such as modularisation, extensibility, generality,
flexibility, high cohesion, low coupling etc. to ensure that the software you
produce is of a suitably high quality. It’s no mean feat that he managed to
cover so much ground within 90 minutes, and with sufficient detail to make the
talk coherent. This is one of those bread-and-butter talks that you need to see
regularly to remind you what your day job is all about. Oh, and the subliminal
elephant images were pretty amusing too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Some much needed sleep meant that I skipped
lunch and went straight into James Coplien’s talk about Lean Architecture and
Agile Software Development. I first saw ‘Cope’ speak at the conference a couple
of years ago and you’re guaranteed entertainment – most likely through controversy.
This time it seems as though the hecklers stayed away as it was somewhat
uneventful although still thoroughly enjoyable. A large part of his talk was
about representing the user’s mental model in the OO paradigm which still often
seems like an enigma when dealing with algorithms and workflows. Also the words
Agile and Lean seem to be used interchangeably in some circles so it was very useful
to get clearer distinctions of how these terms apply to Architecture.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I finished the day in the comfort of Steve
Freeman and Nat Pryce who I had only just seen talking about TDD during a
recent ACCU London meet. This session looked at TDD from the opposite end of
the spectrum by showing how you can grow a complex product though TDD of system-level
tests in a manner similar to designing classes. The premise is to take a slice
of key functionality (instead of a bottom-up or top-down approach) and allow
the system to grow organically from around that point. This was the most
relevant session for me as I’m working on a system incredibly similar to the one
used in their example. I was also somewhat chuffed that I managed to collar
Steve Freeman afterwards so I could pick his brains further on the subject.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Last year the conference introduced
Lightning Talks (short presentations of 5 minutes of whatever topic takes your
fancy) on the Thursday and Friday evenings. They reappeared again this year with
even more speakers so I guess they were pretty popular. The set of 7 talks on
the Thursday contained the usual variety such as “Message Passing Concurrency
in C++” from Dominic Robinson to “What Motivates Programmers” by Kevlin Henney.
There was even time to squeeze in a couple of last minute entries; of which the
most notable was from Tom Gilb to prove that Love can indeed be quantified.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on"><span
  lang=EN-GB>Iceland</span></st1:country-region></st1:place><span lang=EN-GB>
once again hit the news and due to unexpected volcanic activity Dan North’s
keynote was switched with Russel Winder’s on The Multi-core Revolution. The
crux of Russel’s talk was that we need to switch our mental model from one
where processor and memory are equal partners, and infinitely scalable on the
CPU side, to a more realistic model whereby there are many processors each with
dedicated memory connected by an “interconnect” (think bus, network and
anything else in between). This paradigm shift currently requires non-standard
tooling and Russel spent time showing the status quo, such as language
extensions like OpenMP to more purpose built languages like Fortress. Naturally
he got a plug in for Groovy and also managed an interesting tangent about the
Higgs boson. Although Herb Sutter raised awareness about how much we’re going
to need concurrency in the future, Russel’s talk made it clear that
multi-threading and NUMA style architectures are merely another stop gap on the
way to true parallelism.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I just about managed to squeeze a coffee in
before sitting down to hear Richard Harris talk about floating-point numbers.
This is a topic with so much Lore behind it that I felt if anyone could bring
order to this chaos it was Baron Muncharris. The session started much as any classroom
would with the Teacher laying down the ground rules (no whispering, no chewing
gum etc) before embarking on a journey into the various sorts of numbers from
simple Integers to Rational and Transcendental etc. Recent graduates probably
know all this stuff but for old timers it was an excellent refresher and just
what was needed to ensure that you then understood the trade-off’s between the
various proposed solutions, such as IEEE 754, Fixed Point, and Arbitrary
Precision etc. I certainly feel better equipped to handle this kind of
arithmetic in the future.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Michael Stal provided my post-lunch
interest with a talk on Architecture Refactoring. After modifying Martin
Fowler’s original definition of refactoring so that it could apply to the
architecture as well as the code level, he started to introduce some patterns.
Perhaps not unsurprisingly many of these had direct influence from the core
Gang of Four patterns – but at a higher level – such as introducing a Façade
over multiple external services. He also illustrated how the age old pair of
Coupling &amp; Cohesion can be applied equally at the package level in larger
systems. The rest of the talk covered the differences between refactoring,
reengineering, and rewriting; and even though he provided useful examples and a
nice comparison chart for the three categories, I still felt the distinction
was somewhat academic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>After the break and another cuppa I really
wanted to go to the talks about Hadoop and Database Testing. However Kevlin
Henney was talking about the Value Object pattern at the same time and this
area puzzles me more now that I have switched from C++ to C#. Foolishly I
thought I could start in Kevlin’s and then switch to Sven’s Database Testing session
at half time. After ten minutes I was so engrossed in the philosophy of what
Values are and how the implementation of them differs across languages that I
realised I was never going to walk out half way through. Writing code to
compare for equivalence seems far harder in C# and Java than in C++ and Kevlin
nicely demonstrated all the gnarly bits – including some issues that have been
missed by the C# guidelines. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The second set of 9 Lightning Talks were
held in the early evening, and once again there was a good turnout, both from
speakers and audience alike. I even threw my hat into the ring this time with <span
class=GramE>a homage</span> to the BBC 2 comedy show “Room 101” by berating the
continued existence of Visual SourceSafe, Visual C++ 6 and Internet Explorer 6.
I was accompanied by far more straight laced affairs such as Rachel Davies
short piece on Retrospectives and Dietmar Kuehl with a revised look at the “Law
of The Big Three”. Phil Nash, who was originally due to speak with Pete
Goodliffe on iPhone Development, also made a last minute appearance to plug the
iPad.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Friday evening plays host to the Speaker’s
Dinner, where each dinner table has a number of speakers and after each course
the guests are forced (would you argue with Giovanni?) to swap tables. This
gives us the chance to converse with the speakers on a more personal level, and
more importantly to make new friendships with fellow delegates. Naturally there
was much discussion surrounding the volcanic activity, not least because so
many of the speakers and delegates had flown in from around the world. The dinner
naturally spills over into the bar and continues on into the early hours, but
sadly there was no Boat Race this year.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The ongoing disruption to flights meant
that Dan North never made it to the conference and so Saturday’s keynote became
a Mash-Up as four previous speakers each contributed 15 minutes. I snuck in
just as Walter Bright was describing C’s worse mistake – namely the whole array
debacle. Arrays without knowledge of their size, the use of the nul terminator
for strings and the way arrays decay to pointers gave him plenty of ammunition.
James Bach was next up with a quick session on Testing Models. Finally Jim
Hague repurposed his previous evening’s lightning talk as he now had the extra
time needed to fill us in with a little more history on the Devils DP Dictionary
and Stan Kelly-Bootle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I chose to listen to Tony Barrett-Powell in
the morning about Coupling – not the TV show – but the dependencies that exist
within our code. I was well aware of the concept of coupling but didn’t realise
that it had been categorised in so much detail. Tony listed 8 different forms
such as Data Coupling, Stamp Coupling, and Control Coupling etc. This was
second time this conference that I discovered that there is still much goodness
in those old books about Structured Programming. Tony also displayed a chart
that showed which forms of coupling ring the biggest alarm bells and those
which are less insidious. He then went on to do the same with Cohesion and
package-level coupling (Afferent and Efferent Coupling). The second half looked
at various problems and techniques that can used to reduce the damaging effects
such as the Law of Demeter, Open-Closed Principle and DRY etc. This, like Steve
Love’s talk, was one that you could never tire of hearing because it influences
you day-to-day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>My final session of the conference was to
be with Roger Orr. His talk was about configuration – from the reasons why you
might want to, to the mechanisms themselves and the obvious pitfalls. I thought
he started with a rather novel approach by taking the C++ one-liner for outputting
“Hello World” and discussing why and how you might choose to configure such a
simple program. One of the techniques was to pass a #define on the compiler
command line which I had never really thought of as a form of configuration
before. He then went on to cover the usual suspects like the process’ command
line, environment variables, Windows registry, database etc with a short list
of pro’s and con’s about each. Roger is always happy to let the audience
contribute which makes a talk like this so incredibly useful; it often feels
more like a workshop.<span style='text-transform:uppercase'><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>So this is my third year, has it lost any
of the magic yet? Nope – not at all. As I get older I find the late nights in
the bar are getting a little more difficult to cope with, but I still daren’t
go to bed as I’m afraid I’ll miss out on something important. Even though the
number of people I know personally in the ACCU is growing with each conference
I still keep finding new people to whittle away the night with – there seems so
much to chat about and yet so little time. It’s great that all the presenters
are so approachable and many also stay up late in the bar which gives you more
time with them. There are always a few special moments and this year, for me, it
was being privy to a conversation between Walter Bright, Russel Winder a few
others about parallelising compilation in the impending multi-core world. That
kind of thing just doesn’t happen in the sort of places where I work…</span></p>
