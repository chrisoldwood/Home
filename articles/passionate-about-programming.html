<h1 align=center style='text-align:center'><span class=GramE><span lang=EN-GB>Passionate
About Programming or Passionate About Life?</span></span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span lang=EN-GB>“Life
moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could
miss it.” -- Ferris Bueller.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There is a recurring topic that crops up at
the ACCU Conference during the lightning talks and this year was no exception.
In the first round of lightning talks Bjo&#776;rn Fahller asked the question “Why
Are (Only) We Here?” And in the second set, Mike Long continued the trend with
a talk titled “Passionate vs. Professional.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Interestingly the use of the term
“passionate” was itself questioned by Seb Rose in his own 12” edition of the
lightning talks with “Are You Passionate?” For those that weren’t there I
suggest you look the word up in the dictionary and draw your own conclusions.
For what it’s worth I agree with Seb’s sentiment, but I’m still going to stick
to what I believe we mean by the word as it adds fuel to this particular fire…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>So, let me ignite it now by suggesting that
not everyone who works as a computer programmer does it because they are
passionate about it. Yes, some of us cut our teeth on a home computer and are
still bemused how we ended up getting paid to do what was essentially our hobby
before entering employment. But that only applies to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>some</i> of us. That’s right; lots of people actually do a job for
reasons other than the love of it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Many of the people I have worked with in
the past do enjoy what they do. To go back to Seb’s point about the word
“passionate”, let me suggest (after clicking Shift+F7 to bring <span
class=GramE>up</span> the Thesaurus) the slightly watered down “enthusiastic”
instead. Programming is a career that they have chosen because they are
genuinely interested in the subject. But I have also worked with others for
whom programming was never really the end goal – they do it because it pays
reasonably well (very well in certain industries) and perhaps they’re better at
it than other careers they originally had in mind. They are not, and never
expect to be, The Best of the Best, but does every programmer have to aspire to
be that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>When I went to university back in the late
‘80’s I studied Electronic Systems Engineering. My choice was based on my dream
of working in the Audio industry because I loved music and I loved my hi-fi. It
turned out that I sucked really badly at analogue electronics! However I had
slightly more success in the digital realm and eventually discovered that
writing software was an actual profession, and one that I might be a little
better (and therefore more successful) at.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I am one of the lucky ones who managed to
make a course correction early in life and end up doing what I had already been
doing for the 7 years prior to university, but hopefully in a somewhat more
“professional” manner. Of course not everyone is fortunate enough to have their
path laid out clearly before them and so instead they fall into a job that pays
the bills and then see where it goes. And so, if the mortgage is covered and
it’s not detestable, then why shouldn’t that be enough for some?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There’s that word “professional” this time.
What does that mean exactly? I can tell you I believe it doesn’t include committing
a load of changes that haven’t even been compiled just before going off on a
week’s holiday. But what about some of the practices that many of us feel are
beneficial to a sustainable system, say, test-first versus test-later or
continuous integration? What’s the penance for not adopting these and
continuing to work in an “old fashioned” way? If the goal is to deliver working
software then surely <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>how</i> that’s
achieved is of secondary importance to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>if</i>
it’s achieved?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I once worked with a chap at a big corporation
who was purely in “the programming profession” to fund his non-working life.
This was quite an eye opener for me as I couldn’t fault his rationale even
though the inefficiencies of his development style used to annoy the hell out
of me. I tried (largely in vain) to evangelise about the virtues of certain
modern development practices but ultimately they fell on deaf ears. His
performance wasn’t brilliant, but via perspiration he would end up delivering
something that works. Is it “unprofessional” to get the job done in ways that
perhaps not everyone agrees on? As his peer I had to leave him to it; just so
long as what he did had no direct affect on my ability to deliver.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>You can of course argue that poor design,
lack of tests, blah, blah, blah all leads to an increased delivery time for
subsequent changes and so it will <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>eventually</i>
affect my ability to make changes. But I do not feel that is of my concern –
that is a management issue to me. Like it or not software development is rife
with politics and the “performance” of an individual is just one facet that
determines the make-up of a team. Much to the chagrin of one manager I worked
with, you can’t just fire someone because you’ve found a better replacement.
Anyone who has ever worked in a large corporation will wince when I mention the
term “head count” – a pejorative used to describe why you sometimes have to
settle for the 10<sup>th</sup> best interview candidate instead of holding out
for the 1<sup>st </sup>or 2<sup>nd</sup>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>In (my) ideal world there would be a causal
relationship between “coolness” of project, quality of team members, and rate of
pay; with them all increasing together. Sadly it’s more likely that there is an
inverse square law in effect somewhere as there are industries that seem to
rely on youth and adoration to compensate for a lack of remuneration.
Conversely you’d expect Finance, with its deeper pockets, to only hire the
best-of-the-best; but I can assure you that hypothesis doesn’t hold water
either.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Coming back to the original question then,
I wonder if there is an expectation that ACCU conference attendees (or <st1:stockticker
w:st="on">SPA</st1:stockticker>, QCon, etc.) are considered by some as “the
norm”, whereas those who choose explicitly not to go are somehow “exceptional”
for not wanting to better themselves? There is a third group of people who are even
unaware of such events, but I’m guessing the most curiosity comes from those
who choose to ignore our evangelism rather than embrace it. I don’t believe
anyone genuinely goes out of their way to be a Luddite, although people can
become disgruntled when they believe they have been treated unfairly. Instead
I’ve come to see my fellow programmers as people with different abilities, and
more importantly, with different <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>priorities</i>.
They all have a desire to learn and improve; it’s just that they’ve chosen a
rate that is much lower than we have chosen for ourselves. Is it
“unprofessional” to be a slow learner?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I’m sure I didn’t fool anyone with the purposefully
controversial title that suggests it’s impossible to enjoy a career in programming
and at the same time enjoy a fruitful life. In essence it’s a thinly veiled
attempt to re-cast the age old debate of “live to work” or “work to live” into
a programming context. Clearly each of us has a right to devote as much or as
little time, outside our normal working day, to our career progression as we
see fit. What I’m going to suggest, and I’m sure I’ll be labelled a heretic for
suggesting it, is that the next time you are presented with the question of why
you are there, is to first ask yourself why you’re not snowboarding on the
Alps, lazing on the beach soaking up the rays or curled up on the sofa reading
a trashy novel?</span></p>
