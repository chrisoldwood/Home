<p class=MsoTitle>Afterwood - Quote Top Trumps</p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the benefits of living on a small island (Great Britain)
is that you have plenty of old fashioned nautical terms to draw on when discussing
matters of software development. For example, I’ve contributed a short segment to
the Early Career’s Day at the ACCU Conference in recent years and you can probably
imagine my joy at realising I’d be talking about quality in software development
in Bristol – home of the expression “shipshape and Bristol fashion” – which naturally
I adopted as my title.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of my other nautical favourites that I’m accused of
saying far too regularly (and causes my children to roll their eyes) is “don’t
spoil the ship for a ha’p’orth of tar”. (The word ha’p’orth is a contraction of
halfpennyworth.) Sadly, this gets more airing than I’d like because the quality
conversation can tend occasionally towards cutting corners instead of taking
that little bit of extra time to refactor more deeply or add test cases to
cover the error scenarios.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are of course plenty of nautical terms which are still
in common use by <i>normal</i> people too and I’m not adverse to “showing
someone the ropes” or “trying a different tack”, although I don’t think I could
ever bring myself to “on-board” someone (it’s a phrase I’d happily give a wide
berth to). Interestingly the not too uncommon expression “a rising tide lifts
all boats”, which I find particularly useful when trying express the importance
of team members sharing their time and knowledge for the greater good, is believed
to be a fairly modern invention.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What I like about many of these old-fashioned terms is that
they add a little colour to what can be a somewhat abstract but nonetheless
contentious topic. While the phrase “best practice” gets tossed around a lot it’s
debatable whether any are truly “best” – more likely is that they are better than
others in some circumstances. Hence any conversation around deciding how much
effort to spend on improving matters in any given situation becomes less objective,
and more subjective, and therefore largely about what your gut instinct tells
you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once the conversation enters this abstract territory it can
become (as an old work colleague once described it) a game of Top Trumps where
you use quotes from various industry “luminaries” to try and back up your side
of the argument. I suspect no topic in software development has anywhere near
as many sayings as those about simplicity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For example, in languages like C# and Java it is not
uncommon to be faced with a solution to a problem which is implemented in a
dizzying array of interfaces and classes when a couple of extension methods
could just as easily do the job. For this scenario I like to play the John Carmack
card:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>“Sometimes, the elegant
implementation is just a function. Not a method. Not a class. Not a framework.
Just a function.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the author of such seminal games as Doom and Quake his
opinion should hold a lot of sway, but if you’re dealing with code from someone
more classically trained you might need to draw on someone from a different era.
Your deck probably holds a solid collection of quotes from the legendary Sir
Tony Hoare (with the most heavily worn card likely being one on premature optimization)
but I find this observation of his particularly useful for proposing further refactoring:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>“There are two ways of
constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are
obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that
there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In extreme cases the protagonist may choose to counter with
their performance card which luckily you can quickly neutralize with the
aforementioned Sir Tony Hoare power card. But you may feel the need to finish off
the round once and for all by hitting them with a double whammy by plucking out
Hal Abelson’s famous words from Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>“Programs must be written for
people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For a trifecta you might consider playing Martin Fowler’s variation
about any fool being able to write code a computer can understand, but an ad
hominem attack like this would be more Donald Trump than Top Trump, so don’t.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The benefits of deleting code can never be overstated either,
especially dead code and comments which provide no value, and, more importantly,
code which can be further simplified by leveraging existing features of the language
or standard library. For this we need to flick through the cards from our early
20<sup>th</sup> century section and draw something wonderfully profound from Antoine
de Saint-Exupéry:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>“Perfection is achieved, not when
there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not all programming quotes can or should be weaponised though.
Sometimes we can be too quick to judge the efforts of our ancestors and ascribe
the actions to malice or stupidity when in fact it was neither. This quote from
Gerry Weinberg is a wonderful reminder about how hindsight is 20/20:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>“Things are the way they are
because they got that way ... one logical step at a time.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I think we are fortunate now to be living in an age where less
emphasis is being placed on talking about failure and more on using it as an opportunity
to learn. The late Fred Brooks has a particularly memorable quote which I think
extols that notion of continuous personal development:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>“Good judgement comes from
experience, and experience comes from bad judgement.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Despite being relatively new in comparison to the maritime industry
we are still blessed with plenty of our own expressions to draw from. As Andrew
Tanenbaum once said (sic) “the good thing about quotes is that there are so
many to choose from.”</p>

<h3>Biography</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chris is a freelance programmer who started out as a bedroom
coder in the 80’s writing assembly language on 8-bit micros. These days it's
enterprise grade technology <s>in plush corporate offices</s> from the comfort of
his breakfast bar. He has resumed commentating on the Godmanchester duck race but
continues to be easily distracted by emails and DMs to gort@cix.co.uk and
@chrisoldwood.</p>
