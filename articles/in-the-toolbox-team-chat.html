<h1 align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>In The Toolbox –
Team Chat</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>As I write this MSN Messenger is taking its
last few breaths before Microsoft confine it to history. Now that they own
Skype they have two competing products and I guess one has to go. I’m sad to
see it be retired because it was the first instant messaging product I used to
communicate with work colleagues whilst I was both in and out of the office.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>At my first programming job back in the
early 90’s the company used Pegasus Mail for email as they were running Novell NetWare.
They also used <span class=SpellE>TelePathy</span> (a DOS based OLR) to host some
in-house forums and act as a bridge to the online worlds of CompuServe, CIX,
etc. Back then I hardly knew anyone with an email address and it was a small
company so I barely got any traffic. The conferencing system (more
affectionately known as TP) on the other hand was a great way to “chat” with my
work colleagues in a more asynchronous fashion. Although some of the conversations
were social in nature, having access to the technical online forums was an essential
developer aid. Even the business (a small software house) used it occasionally,
such as to “connect” the marketing and development teams. Whereas email was
used in a closed, point-to-point manner, the more open chat system allowed for
the serendipitous water-cooler moments through the process of eavesdropping.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>As the Internet took off the landscape
changed dramatically with the classic dial-up conferencing systems and bulletin
boards (<span class=SpellE>BBS’s</span>) trying to survive the barrage of web
based forums and ubiquitous access to the Usenet. Although I did a couple of
contracts at large corporations I still had little use for office email and
that continued when I joined a small finance company around the turn of the
millennium.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It was nice being back in a small company –
working with other fathers who also had a desire to actually spend time with
their families – because it meant we could set up remote working. The remote
access was VPN based (rather than remote desktop) which meant that we would have
to configure Outlook locally to talk to the Exchange server in the office. This
was somewhat harder back then and it was just another memory hog to have cluttering
up your task bar. A few of us had been playing with this new MSN Messenger
thing, which, because we were signed up personally meant that whether we were
at home or in the office we easily talk to each other. Given our desire to
distribute our working hours in a more family friendly manner that meant we
often found ourselves working (remotely) alongside a team-mate in the evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Instant messaging soon became an integral
part of how the team communicated. With the likelihood that at least one of us
was working from home we could still discuss most problems when needed. Of
course there was always the option to pick up the old fashioned telephone if
the limited bandwidth became an issue or the emoticon count reached epidemic
proportions. Even 3 and 4-way conversations seemed to work quite painlessly. However
shared desktops and white-boards felt more like pulling teeth, even over a massive
128 Kbps broadband connection.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Eventually I had to move and I ended up
back at one of those big corporations – one that was the complete opposite of
my predecessor. Here everything was blocked, you couldn’t (or shouldn’t) install
anything without approval and instant messaging was blocked by the company
firewall. In this organisation email ruled. This was not really surprising
because The Business, development teams, infrastructure teams, etc. were all physically
separated. Consequently emails would grow and grow like a snowball as they
acquired more recipients, questions and replies until eventually they would
finally die (probably under their own weight) and just clog up the backup
tapes. The company’s technical forums were also run using email distribution
lists. Anyone brave enough to post a question had to consider the value of potentially
getting an answer versus spending the next 20 minutes dealing with the deluge
of Out of Office replies from the absent forum participants. They even had a
special “Reply All” plug-in that would pop up a message box to check if you
were really, really, really sure that every recipient you were intending to
spam actually needed to see your finest display of English prose and vast
knowledge of the subject matter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Little known to most employees the company
actually ran an internal IRC style chat service. Presumably, in an attempt to
reduce the pummelling the Exchange Server was taking, they forced their
developers to “discover” it by making the chat client start up every time they
logged in. They also disbanded the email distribution lists and set up IRC
channels instead. Even the ACCU had its own channel!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It may sound like a draconian tactic, but
it worked, and I for <st1:time Minute="0" Hour="1" w:st="on">one am</st1:time>
really glad they did. Suddenly the heydays of the conferencing system I had
used back in the beginning were available once more. Although there was a
“miscellaneous” topic where a little social chit-chat went on I’d say that
by-and-large the vast majority of the public traffic was work related. Both
junior and senior developers could easily get help from other employees on a
range of technical subjects covering tools and languages. Naturally, given the tighter
feedback loop, the conversations easily escalated to the level of “what problem
are you trying to solve exactly?” which is often where the real answer lies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>One particular channel was set up to try
and enable more cross pollination of internal libraries and tools. In an
organisation of their size I would dread to think how many logging libraries
and thread pools had been implemented by different teams over the years. Our system
also had its own dedicated channel too which made communicating with our
off-shore teams less reliant on email. Given the number of development branches
and test environments in use this was a blessing that kept the inbox level sane.
The service recorded all conversations, which I’m sure to some degree kept the
chatter honest, but more importantly transcripts were available via a search
engine which made <span class=SpellE>FAQs</span> easier to handle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:170.4pt'><span lang=EN-GB><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>                                                         </span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>When it came time to move contracts once
more I was sorely disappointed to find myself back where I was originally with
the last company. Actually it was worse because there were no internal
discussion lists either that I could find. Determined not to let my inbox get
spammed with pointless chatter I set up a simple IRC server for our team to
use. My desire was to sell its benefits to other teams and perhaps even get some
communities going, even if we had to continue hosting the server ourselves. Internally
the company had Office Communicator (OC), which in the intervening years had
acquired the same chat product my previous client used, but sadly this extra add-on
was never rolled out and so we remained with our simple IRC setup. Contact with
some of the support teams was occasionally via OC but email still remained
dominant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>For me IRC style communication has been
perfect for the more mundane stuff. For example things like owning up to a
build break, messing with a test environment, forwarding links to interesting
blog posts or just polling to see if anyone is up for coffee. Using a
persistent chat service (or enabling client side logging) also allows it be
used as a record of events which can be particularly useful when diagnosing a
production problem.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I suspect that from a company’s perspective
they are worried that such as service will be abused and used for “social
networking” instead, which is probably why they blocks sites like <span
class=GramE>Twitter</span> and Facebook. However, if teams are left to their
own devices they will fill the void anyway and so a company is better off providing
their own service which everyone expects will be monitored and so will probably
self-regulate. But the biggest benefit must surely come from the sharing of
knowledge in both the technical and problem domains. As the old saying goes “a
rising tide lifts all boats”.</span></p>
