<h1 align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>In The Toolbox –
Static Code Analysis</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There is a certain level of satisfaction to
be gained from tracking down a really gnarly bug. If it’s a really tough one
you might even be inclined to punch the air in a physical gesture that reflects
the effort you put into finding it. Of course we’d all wish this was never
needed; that we’d always write bug free code. Or at least track it down very
quickly during (unit) testing when the code is freshest in our minds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The antithesis of this is tracking down a
bug only to find that a tool could have easily pointed it out for you. I find
this kind of bug soul destroying because I know I’ve just wasted part of my
life doing something the very machine I’m programming could have saved me from.
Static Code Analysis is one of those tasks that a machine is perfectly suited to
as it systematically reviews your code and points out those places where the
dragons may be lying in wait.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>To Err Is Human</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>One of the most common mistakes I used to
make in my earlier days was the “assignment instead of comparison” inside an
“if” statement, e.g. writing </span><code><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
10.0pt'>if (x = 2)</span></code><span lang=EN-GB> instead of </span><code><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>if (x == 2)</span></code><span lang=EN-GB>.
Another common mistake I used to fall foul of was uninitialised variables. There
was always a desire to avoid unnecessarily initialising a variable with a default
value despite the danger of ending up with a code path that might use its
uninitialised value. The mantra of “not paying for what you don’t use” can lead
you to prematurely optimise your code’s execution speed at the cost of
significantly increased development time, and subsequent hair loss.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There have been attempts to try and write
code in a different style as a way of avoiding some of the more common
mistakes. One of the most notable is probably the swapping of the arguments in
an “if” statement so that you would end up trying to assign to a literal value
instead of the variable, e.g. instead of writing </span><code><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt'>if (x == 2)</span></code><span lang=EN-GB> you use </span><code><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>if (2 == x)</span></code><span lang=EN-GB>.
But that just makes the code harder to read, and anyway it doesn’t work when
non-const variables are involved. The Single Assignment pattern [1], which gets
an added boost via </span><code><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>const</span></code><span
lang=EN-GB> in C++ and </span><code><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>final</span></code><span
lang=EN-GB> in Java, is a more human friendly approach to the problem, e.g.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><code><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>    <b>const
std::string</b> input = getInput();</span></code></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><code><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>    <b>const
size_t</b> index = input.find_first_of(‘&lt;’);</span></code></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><code><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></code></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><code><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>    if (index
== std::string::npos)</span></code></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>The Free Lunch?</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Contorting your code to avoid common coding
problems should not be your first line of inquiry. This is even more true today
as the very first bit of advice in Steve Maguire’s 1993 book Writing Solid Code,
is this:-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“Enable all the
optional warnings in your compiler”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Those more familiar with the similarly aged
Code Complete by the other Steve (McConnell) have to wait a little longer for
the same advice, almost until the end of the book (Chapter 26 – Debugging) but
it’s still there. This should be done in companion with enabling “warnings as
errors” to make sure you don’t just try and ignore what the compiler <i>might</i>
be trying to tell you. Yes, in many cases the warnings are possibly benign, but
if you fail to deal with the issue there-and-then you risk missing the really
important stuff in a sea of trivia when it finally rears its ugly head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The best part about that advice is that
it’s pretty much free. You’ve already paid for the compiler (either in pennies
or time) and so you might as well put it to good use. In these modern times
where there is an abundance of Open Source Software, even if you aren’t using
it for your production builds, it can still be used as an additional pair of
eyes that will cast a second opinion on your codebase.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>For many years I was perfectly happy using
/W4 /WX with Visual C++ and felt reasonably smug that I was getting some decent
static analysis (this was long before they added the extra code analysis). Then,
after a fair bit of refactoring I managed to get GCC to at least compile parts
of my codebase (not all and it still wouldn’t link) and yet I was amazed at how
much extra free static analysis I had been missing out on. GCC highlighted
another 14 potential issues that Visual C++ was silent on. And this was before
I had turned on the standards compliance and portability settings (which I had
little need for production-wise). Clearly a propriety company like Microsoft has
a vested interest in making money from their extra smarts and with an
Enterprise-style budget you may get more out-of-the-box, but it just goes to remind
us that the OSS offerings can often play and even outsmart their rivals in the
big leagues.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>As an aside the main place where the most
refactoring was needed was in my COM components. I had a bit of extra work to manually
convince the MIDL compiler to throw out something GCC could directly consume,
as Visual C++ invokes it automatically, and I had to provide some workarounds
for VC++ specific extensions like </span><code><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt'>__uuidof</span></code><span lang=EN-GB>. But, once that
was done it meant a whole lot more code could be put under the microscope. In
particular it highlighted a number of places in my error handling where I had
switched from a custom string implementation (that had the same memory
footprint as a </span><code><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>char*</span></code><span
lang=EN-GB>) to </span><code><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>std::string</span></code><span
lang=EN-GB> and I was passing it by value to a </span><code><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:10.0pt'>printf()</span></code><span lang=EN-GB> style variable
args function.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Custom Tooling</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>With potentially so much on offer before
getting your wallet out you might be thinking there is little point in spending
any money on custom tooling. Aside from the grief I’d get from at least one
prominent ACCU member by suggesting that strategy, it’s simply not true – there
is definitely a lot of value in tools like the venerable Lint. For starters not
all languages even need a compiler, e.g. JavaScript, and so that’s not even an
option. Secondly, even if you do have a compilation step, custom tools like
Lint can provide more extensive coverage simply because they’re more focused in
finding bugs in your code instead of generating binaries. Going back to
JavaScript for a moment, Douglas Crockford, author of JavaScript: The Good
Parts, illustrates nicely in his book how a tool like JSLint is essential due
to some pretty ugly language features.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>If you think that the cost of a license for
a commercial tool like PC-lint (as opposed to one of the more extortionately
priced tools) is too much, consider how much programmer time you’ve lost
through bugs like uninitialised variables or missing/badly written copy
constructors. Whilst working for a large bank, I was turned down access to PC-lint
because they only had a handful of licenses. During that project I know of at
least two occasions where programmers had lost an entire day tracking down a
bug caused by just such an issue and both developers were paid more per day
than a single license of the software that could have found it for them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Of course there is a start-up cost in
introducing such a tool and that cost is much larger on a legacy system, but as
Anna-Jayne Metcalfe showed in her 2008 ACCU London [2] talk you don’t have to jump
in and try and fix everything right at the start. You need to start small,
enabling only the analysis of the most serious problems and then progress from
there. Whilst integration into your build pipeline is an excellent eventual
goal, just running it regularly manually should pay early dividends.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Design Smells</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Once you get passed the hardcore problems
you might begin to wonder how much value there is in some of the softer
complaints or suggestions the tool makes. ReSharper, which is a tool for the
.Net world (although they’re moving into the realms of C++) will point out
where you can pass an iterator instead of a container, because it can see that
you’ve only iterated it. While both forms are <i>technically</i> correct, given
the lack of const in C# along with the standard containers being mutable,
you’re probably taking unnecessary liberties. Similarly I’ve seen cases where
ReSharper spots that methods and even whole classes can be declared static
which saves on unnecessary heap churn. The lack of free functions in C# coupled
with an attitude that “static is bad” [3] means that some designs overuse
Object-Orientation when a simple function will suffice.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Learning Aid</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>This brings me along nicely to my final
reason for using such a tool – it’s also a learning aid. As we get more
experienced we make far less of the fundamental errors as we begin to remember
the things that constantly trip us up, but in the early days we’re like a
toddler as we keep falling over. Switch to a new language though, and even if
we’re an experienced developer we can still regress back to that toddler stage
if there are enough differences. Even moving to a new project that uses a newer
version of the same language can surprise you as you might have forgotten all
the cool things they added but you’ve yet to be able to get practical
experience with.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>My own move from long term C++ developer to
n00b C# developer was helped in part by a similarity in the languages around
the basic constructs but also through the use of a static code analysis tool to
show me the finer details. More recently the move from .Net 3.5 to .Net 4.0
means that named and optional arguments are now at my disposal which I keep
forgetting (although it’s the former rather that latter which I’m more interested
in).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>By far the biggest win though has been in learning
LINQ, which can be accessed either directly via the C# extension methods, or
through the syntactic sugar the language provides. In the beginning I could
write the really obvious SQL-like format pretty quickly but some of the more
subtle forms, such as when transforming to a Dictionary, I struggled with. When
I saw the tool suggest it could change the structure of my code I first guessed
what it might do, then reveal what the answer was. If I didn’t get it right I’d
switch back and forth with the editor’s Undo/Redo command to try and understand
what it was proposing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Even now when I see an error message, say,
from the compiler I generally try not to read what the actual error messages says,
instead favouring to just jump right to the code to see if I can quickly spot
what the compiler has picked up.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Keep Control </span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It’s tempting when you see a barrage of
issues reported by a tool like this to just go through blindly and accept the
changes it suggests on the basis that “it’s always right”. In the case of some
of the LINQ transformations I’ve seen it do I’d definitely question that
wisdom. A tool like this should be there to watch your back and do <i>your</i>
bidding, don’t let it get out of control and start writing your code for you. The
code it generates may be syntactically correct but it may not express it in the
most human readable way and share your design intent.</span></p>
