<p class=MsoNormal>I always find writing an article at this time of year particularly
challenging. Due to the lead time in publishing we’re currently celebrating
Halloween, but by the time this hits the metaphorical shelves we’ll be enjoying
the Christmas festivities. In the world of programming this Halloween / Christmas
duality is even immortalised in a joke that riffs on date formats and number bases
to illustrate that “<span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>OCT 31 == DEC 25</span>”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you’ve ever worked with databases you may have come
across The Halloween Problem. This was an issue coined back in the 1970’s where
a database update to adjust employee salaries used an index on the <i>same</i>
column that was being updated. As each salary was increased it caused the row
to move further down the index and consequently was visited multiple times, meaning
that every salary was bumped repeatedly until it exceeded the threshold specified
for the raise. If you were one of the lowest paid employees in that company, then
Christmas would definitely have come very early that year!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By the time I had started working with databases all these
issues had been worked out and the ACID guarantee had become a staple question at
job interviews. It wasn’t until the rise of the NoSQL movement in the late 2000’s
and the new breed of document-oriented databases like CouchDB and MongoDB that
I started to become more aware of issues like The Halloween Problem, and its
associated problems like Phantom Reads. The performance demands of “Web 2.0 at
scale” meant that the cool kids were happy to trade their ACID guarantees for throughput,
and so the pendulum started to swing back the other way, and we also got to use
the new excuse “eventual consistency” whenever things didn’t quite add up. In those
early days some database products traded off more than just the ACID guarantees,
in the race to appear fastest in the benchmarks they chose dangerous defaults
which meant you couldn’t even be sure if your request left the machine. The pitchforks
came out, the “NoSQL Considered Harmful” posts were written, and the pendulum
swung back again towards the Pit of Success.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even if you do manage to avoid the phantoms in your result-sets
you’ll struggle to escape one of the most curious perversions in relational database
logic — the non-value “NULL”. After scratching your head wondering why your SQL
query doesn’t work as you expect when NULLs are present, you learn that one NULL
does not equal another NULL and you need to litter your SQL code with IS NULL, ISNULL,
COALESCE, etc. instead. Until that is you introduce certain aggregations,
grouping, or sorting constructs at which point NULL starts to feel like it does
have equivalence semantics after all. But the SQL standards committee are a
cunning bunch and with a little sleight of hand they sidestep the apparent similarities
of equivalence by introducing the concept of “distinctness” instead and any
notion of equivalence remains merely a figment of your imagination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If a database NULL is a value which doesn’t exist, then in
the world of floating-point numbers the undead comes in the form of a nan – once
a number, full of life, but now destined to walk the Earth turning every other
number it meets into the undead too. This one really is evil though as there is
no standards committee to save you here if one creeps into your collection before
you try and sort it. Depending on the language and sort implementation you
might be lucky and escape with a sequence that remains intact whereas if you’re
unlucky your sort won’t complete until the heat death of the universe making
the outcome a moot point. I’m pretty sure IEEE754 wasn’t what the late Fred
Brooks had in mind when we warned us there was no silver bullet but maybe he
also advised us to decorate our collection types with garlic in one of his lesser-known
essays.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you’ve dabbled in computing for even a small amount of
time you’ll likely have experienced The Ghost in the Machine. Like many real-world
ghost sightings they eventually get debunked. That elusive bug, which initially
appears to be from another realm turns out to be entirely real, and all too
often self-inflicted. We might call it Undefined Behaviour to avoid frightening
the children but it’s really a portal to another dimension where only those
tooled up like Ash Williams will make it out alive. C++ in particular has the kind
of power to contact the dead all too easy, although it tends to be hackers that
celebrate its “use after free” abilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Einstein famously coined the phrase “spooky action at a
distance” to describe the weirdness of quantum mechanics but you don’t need to
delve <i>that</i> far down the technology stack to experience the spookiness of
hardware. Even though we’re becoming less susceptible to the vagaries of some
older technologies like hard disk drives, aka “spinning rust”, we are more reliant
on network connectivity, meaning that Leslie Lamport’s famous quip from the
late 80’s about distributed systems and being reliant on computers you didn’t even
know exist is becoming ever more prescient. Failing and loosely seated RAM
chips also provide just enough of a distraction to make you question your
sanity before declaring the host cursed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The complexities of modern hardware and software can make it
feel like you’re constantly being haunted by a poltergeist as you struggle to
reason why your code is not behaving the way you intended. Halloween might only
be one day for normal people but for programmers it can feel like we’re permanently
living in The Upside Down. When you’re battling with phantoms, daemons, and zombies
sometimes it can feel more like exorcism than programming.</p>

<h3>Biography</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chris is a freelance programmer who started out as a bedroom
coder in the 80’s writing assembly language on 8-bit micros. These days it's
enterprise grade technology <s>in plush corporate offices</s> from the comfort of
his breakfast bar. He also commentates on the Godmanchester duck race and is easily
distracted by emails and DMs to gort@cix.co.uk and @chrisoldwood.</p>
