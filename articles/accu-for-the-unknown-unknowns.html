<div class=Section1>

<h1 align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>ACCU – For the
Unknown Unknowns</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>In the previous issue of C Vu the Editor
asked the question “What is ACCU for?” I think each of us has different ideas
about what they get, and, more importantly, want from being a member of ACCU.
As <st1:PersonName w:st="on">Alan Griffiths</st1:PersonName> has said on a few
occasions in his “From the Chair” in C Vu: the ACCU is what we, the members,
make of it. Whilst I can’t say for sure what I’d want to change, if anything, what
I can say is what it means to me and how I use it. Your mileage will almost
certainly vary…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I’ve written in these pages before about my
own background and how I came to join ACCU [1]. In short, what I was looking
for at the time was a replacement for the C/C++ Users <st1:PersonName w:st="on">Jo</st1:PersonName>urnal
and C++ Report as they had both gone the way of the dodo. What I found took me
by surprise because not only was there deep knowledge of C++, there was also a
lot of discussion about the higher-order aspects of programming in general.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Whilst some might consider a detailed
discussion [2] of a three-line C++ function that parses the surname from a
comma-separated full name to be excessive, I personally found it to be one of
the most thoughtful threads on the <st1:PersonName w:st="on">accu-general</st1:PersonName>
mailing list for some time. What it brought home was how much variation there
can be in such a simple piece of code. Not only was the method of
implementation open to question, with the obvious C++ 98 / C++ 11 dimension,
the choice of argument parsing convention and even the function name itself
went under the microscope in attempt to establish maximum clarity. Although
this was more information than the original poster was after, for (some of) us
bystanders it was an interesting code review.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>In my experience you just don’t get that
attention to detail in the usual forums and newsgroups. Admittedly you don’t
want <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>every</i> discussion to descend into
that level of deconstruction or we’d struggle to even write our supposed industry-standard
10 lines of code per day. But it’s a useful exercise to go through every now
and again to remind ourselves of all the various forces that we need to balance
in our quest to produce simple, maintainable code.<span style='text-transform:
uppercase'><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Whilst I’ve reached a level of programming
ability that puts “the basics” into the area of Conscious Competence [3] I’m
acutely aware that the range of my expertise defined by Conscious Incompetence
grows rapidly bigger. At least the good news is that some of that is no longer
filed under the more disturbing Unconscious Incompetence (or as it’s more
colloquially known: The Unknown Unknowns [4]). And that I largely put down to
my membership of ACCU.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>A common reply to the question of how to
learn more about programming is that there are loads of blogs and forums out
there – so just google it. It’s a fair point, but it also misses the simple
fact that to google something you have to be aware of its existence in the
first place. Sometimes, as was the case with “persistent data structures” I
thought I knew what they were until <st1:PersonName w:st="on">Kevlin Henney</st1:PersonName>’s
Immutability talk at the ACCU conference last week. There I discovered those
people using them as a synonym for “immutable container” were being economical
with the truth. Although it’s quite possible they don’t realise it themselves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Take programming idioms for example. One of
the best methods to learn about new ways of working is to learn other
programming languages, because they force you to solve similar problems in
different ways. When you’re the one attempting to establish a new idiom based
on some other language it’s easy, but when you’re the maintenance programmer
staring at some “weird code” wondering what on the author was thinking it’s a
different prospect. Sometimes there can be a fine line between genius and
incompetence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Have you ever had a problem, spent hours
googling it, found the answer and then tried to google for the answer again
based on what you now know and found the answer at the top of the results list?
I find one of the biggest hurdles to finding the answer to some of the less
technology specific programming questions <span class=GramE>is knowing</span>
the correct terminology to use in the question. What most of my initial
googling tends to be is fumbling around trying to find the correct words to use
for the right search query; once I have them the answer generally comes fairly
quickly, or there are no results and its back to square one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>For me ACCU plays a large role in the
serendipitous side of programming. My awareness of my programming surroundings
comes largely from being a member of this specific organisation. There is also a
time and a place for pedantry and I personally believe that more often than not
its use within ACCU discussions has a positive rather than a negative effect. I
want to understand and use the terminology of our profession (and the ideas
embodied within them) with precision and, so far, I think being an ACCU member
has been the most valuable way of achieving that.</span></p>
