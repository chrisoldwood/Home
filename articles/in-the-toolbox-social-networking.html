<h1 align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>In The Toolbox –
Social Networking</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Right back at the very beginning of this
series of articles [1] I talked about how I had found great utility in
chat-style software as an alternative for email to exchange brief messages with
my team-mates about day-to-day events. Those messages are generally asynchronous
in nature and related to the events going on around me, such as broken builds,
production issues, the forthcoming need for coffee, etc. But when it comes to
aspects of software design the need to converse with a human on a less
constricted form usually takes over. Depending on who’s around at the time it
might mean leaning across a desk, walking down the isle or putting a
metaphorical pen-to-paper and banging out a thought-inducing email (largely to
self, but with the ability for others to provide feedback).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>In the “good old days” they were pretty
much your only choices, but the modern era of smart-phones and ubiquitous
internet access means I’m always within “close” reach of a <span class=GramE>whole</span>
bunch of clever people; some that I already work with but far more that I
don’t. This means I can tap-in to the “wisdom of crowds” to some degree and
perhaps get feedback in the intervening time before my colleagues are once
again around me and able to provide that high-bandwidth communication channel I
need to drill down to the finer details.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Of course dial-up forums like CompuServe
and Cix were around long before the likes of Twitter and Facebook, as were the
Internet-based online forums such as the Usenet. However, although the
readership was large, it varied widely and although I made some metaphorical
friends the transport mechanism was not really up for the social banter that
adds a little more character and background to its users. In fact culturally it
was a faux pas to add mindless chatter because it consumed bandwidth and back
then bandwidth cost serious money when all you had was a modem measured in
kilo-bits per second. In stark contrast, services like Twitter with its
so-called “micro-blogging” format means that the content length is purposefully
constrained and probably means that the transport overhead now dominates the
message size!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It’s seems ironic after the years of
worrying about keeping “on topic” to purposefully choose to use a service that
restricts your freedom. But what I’ve found with the likes of Twitter is that I
can gauge opinion about even very small matters so long I can squeeze it into
140 characters or less. I can on occasion stretch to 280 if I want to try the
patience of my audience, but hopefully they’ll forgive me if it’s interesting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Distilling a problem down to its essence is
a tricky problem, but also a worthy pursuit in its own right as you may even
answer your own question just by going through the motions. The fear of public
ridicule can be a sobering thought too. Occasionally I’ve attempted to frame a
question as a rant to see if I get a “me too” style response or just a “look”
of derision. When you work in a very small or very inexperienced team you
sometimes need to look outside for validation, or a friendly ear. It probably
sounds a little dysfunctional as I should be able to address concerns about my
colleagues and their work directly to them, but in the early stages I like to
keep “the air clear” between us and get a reality check from a third party first
about whether it’s a mountain or a molehill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Social Networking tools have embraced the
whole push model so that you get a stream of collective consciousness delivered
directly to your device. Assuming that you’re one of those people who <span
class=GramE>doesn’t</span> just follow everyone in the world and are interested
in keeping the data stream down to a manageable level, there is a continual
diet of knowledge and sage advice to be had. That insight may come in the form
of a quote from such a luminary as Alan Kay or Sir Tony Hoare. Or it may come
in the thinly veiled guise of “geek humour” such as an XKCD [2] cartoon. Or it
might be an off the cuff remark from one of your fellow ACCU colleagues.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>My own social networking persona is very
much for the purposes of my professional programming career. Although I clearly
make out-of-band comments, the group of people I follow and the content I
generally consume is of a programming related nature. Personally I’m not
interested in trying to maintain a separate “private” persona, but I know of
people that do – so that they can keep their work and personal lives separate
as a way of managing the onslaught of data. Despite probably overdoing it
myself on occasion I do try and stick with those people that provide the highest
signal-to-noise ratio. Tooling has made a big difference here by filtering
messages in an intelligent way so you don’t get cross-talk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The links to blog posts and articles I
receive are often very useful, but I have to squirrel them away with a bookmark
and save them for later consumption. No, what I really enjoy most are the
little pearls of wisdom that act as continual reminders to think about what
we’re doing. Even with the best intentions I lose focus and find myself
slipping back into dubious habits or not bothering to think hard enough about
what the best name might be for a class or method.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>One time I remember lazily naming a class “EngineManager”.
Before I had committed it though a tweet (from <st1:PersonName w:st="on">Allan
 Kelly</st1:PersonName>, I think) appeared commenting on the non-descript
nature of the term “manager” and so I renamed it “EnginePool” as that felt a
better description because it followed the Pool pattern from the POSA 3 book [3].
As if by coincidence another tweet from Nat Pryce arrived bemoaning the use of
pattern names in classes. Oops.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The practice Nat Pryce appeared to be
commenting on is a long-standing joke in Java where there has been a habit of
seeing how many Gang of Four pattern names you can squeeze into one class. In
my case I felt I was quite justified in naming my class with the “Pool” suffix
as it documented the expected behaviour nicely. The point though is that it
made me stop and think.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>And that’s what I enjoy most about having a
stream of one-liners flowing though my consciousness every day, they keep me
honest and remind me of the many forces that I need to keep in balance with
every line of code I write.</span></p>
