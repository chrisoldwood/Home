<p class=MsoTitle>Afterwood</p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Buggles once informed us that video killed the radio
star. Maybe that was true back in the late 1970’s but today it’s “Agile” that’s
killing her instead. Time was when you could nestle into your office chair,
slip on a monster pair of noise-cancelling headphones (the ones that made you
look like a Cyberman) and then really get deeply embroiled in a spot of coding
whilst being surrounded by your favourite tunes! There was no chance of any
interruptions either as long as you didn’t open your email client.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not anymore, not now that we’re all Agile. Such anti-social
behaviour is considered verboten in this new world of total collaboration and
“value driven development”. There is no room for music and isolation in a team
which thrives on pairs or mobs of developers huddling around a single machine
all focused on the singular problem of highest worth. Deodorant is an absolute
essential throughout the day and any thoughts of eating garlic for lunch will
be met with an afternoon of <i>faux</i> hand-wafting gestures and nose pegs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you’re partial to a nice large lunch and the occasional
cheeky pint or two in the hopes that the afternoon can largely drift past as
you drag out the low hanging fruit which you saved for such a special occasion,
think again. The afternoon continues on from where the morning left off, albeit
in a different huddle of people embracing the change in dynamic that keeps the
energy flowing all throughout the day until knocking off time. If 5pm comes and
you’ve not <i>already</i> left – exhausted from hours of collaborative designing,
coding and testing – then your “value generation” meter can’t be full.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Energised work is the name of the game. It’s not just
lunchtime drinking that you’ll knock on the head but a solid evening out
drinking in the pub seems great at the time but the following morning when
you’ve got a stinking hangover and you’re looking to just muddle through the
day you can forget it. The rest of your team will have had their full quota of
8 hours sleep and be buzzing, ready to push another handful of user stories
through the pipeline and out to your loyal band of customers. Time waits for no
man, and neither does the release train either.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Good old fashioned tasks used to take weeks or months, not
days or even just a few hours! If you <i>had</i> to estimate, you had so much
leeway you could easily factor in some extra hours over-and-above any genuine
contingency to include personal administration time as well. We may have a day
job but we also need car and home insurance, there are holidays to book, and
who risks appearing absent by going out to an actual physical supermarket when
you can shop online and appear to be working at the same time? If you only ever
learned one keyboard shortcut I can almost guarantee it was Alt+Tab – the
“boss” key-combo.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While it’s no longer possible to pad out the estimate for your
latest feature to include time sorting out this summer’s touring holiday around
Europe, you’d still hope to squeeze in the odd household chore here and there. But
no, it’s not just you giving estimates these days; the whole team gets to add
their tuppence worth in a planning poker session. Assuming you can even
engineer being the (only) one to implement any particular feature, any attempt
to game the system by giving an overly pessimistic estimate will be met with a public
inquiry from your teammates to understand why your opinion sits out on the periphery
of the Normal curve. Sprint planning is a well-intentioned exercise but it
makes holiday planning an absolute nightmare.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Everything has to be transparent nowadays; the stakeholders get
to see where their money is being spent and they’re also allowed to decide on a
daily basis whether it’s still going in the direction they want it to. The morning
stand-up is just another example of the do-gooders getting to put their oar in
and disrupt the traditional art of procrastination. If you failed at the
planning session to broaden the timescales enough then don’t expect to simply
eat into any contingency during implementation without anyone noticing. You can
almost guarantee some busybody will spot at the stand-up that you’re “stuck” and
will then play the “swarming” card by sacrificing their own opportunity to arrange
an appointment with the dentist by getting your “more valuable” work back on
track instead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We now live in a world of software development that refuses
to tolerate any waste; our entire process is predicated on trimming the fat to
keep the team lean and nimble. Your pairing or mobbing buddies won’t even let
you put a single keystroke out of place without calling it out, let along
managing to slip your own pet feature in under the radar. Instead of a
metaphorical Jiminy Cricket keeping you on the straight and narrow you’ve now got
real ones. The codebase is a meritocracy and every single line has to earn its
keep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>None of this should be a surprise though. Back in the early
70’s, long before The Buggles even existed, Gerry Weinberg published his
seminal book about the psychology of computer programming in which he
identified the social nature of programming and how teams need to have
collaboration as a cornerstone of their behaviour.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yes, I’m sad that my fancy headphones mostly lay dormant in
my bag along with a stack of CDs from Christmas and birthdays that I’ve still
yet to find time to listen to. My desk is largely empty and chair configuration
is far from optimal but I spend so much time at the whiteboard and at other
people’s desks that it hardly seems to matter. Yes, I could shave valuable time
off my morning routine by short-circuiting my personal hygiene if I didn’t have
to share office space with my colleagues.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So would I want to go back to the way things were? No way!
Maybe I’m just a Millennial who was born a decade too early but I’m relishing
this ever decreasing feedback loop and I’m sure that as a result my programming
output will only get better.</p>
