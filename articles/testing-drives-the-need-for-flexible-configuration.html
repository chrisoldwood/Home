Need for Flexible Configuration</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Introduction</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>If you look at a system’s production
configuration settings you could be fooled into thinking that we only need a
simple configuration mechanism that supports a single configuration file. In production
it’s often easier because things have settled down – the correct hardware has
been provisioned, security accounts created, monitoring services installed,
etc. But during development and testing is when the flexibility of your
configuration mechanism really comes into play.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I work on distributed systems which
naturally have quite a few moving parts and one of the biggest hurdles to
development and maintenance in the past has been because the various components
cannot be independently configured so that you can cherry-pick which services
you run locally and which you draw from your integration/system test <span
class=GramE>environment</span>. Local (as in on your desktop) integration
testing puts the biggest strain on your configuration mechanism as you probably
can only afford to run a few of the services that you might need unless your
company also provides fairly meaty developer workstations too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>In the past I’ve found the need to override
component settings using a variety of criteria and the following article is
definitely not exhaustive, but gives the most common reasons I have encountered
for needing to configure something differently. It also goes into a little more
detail about how you might support such multiple configurations whilst
minimising the potential for duplication.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Per-Environment</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The most obvious candidate is environmental
as there is usually a need to have multiple copies of the system running for
different reasons. I would hazard a guess that most teams generally have
separate DEV, TEST &amp; PROD environments to cover each aspect of the classic
software lifecycle. For small systems, or systems with <span class=GramE>a top</span>-notch
build pipeline and test coverage, the DEV &amp; TEST environments may serve the
same purpose. Conversely I have worked on a team that had 7 DEV environments
(one per development stream [Oldwood1]), a couple of TEST environments and a
number of other special environments used for regulatory purposes, all in
addition to the single production instance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>What often <span class=GramE>distinguishes</span>
these environments are the instances of the external services that you will
depend on. It is common for all production environments to be ring-fenced so
that you only have PROD talking to PROD to ensure isolation. In some cases you
may be lucky enough to have UAT talking to some read-only PROD services,
perhaps to support parallel running. But DEV environments are often in a sorry
state and highly distrusted so are ring-fenced for the same reason as PROD, but
this time for the stability of everyone else’s systems.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Where possible I prefer the non-production
environments to be a true mirror of the production one, with the minimum
changes required to work around environmental differences. Ideally we’d have
infinite hardware so that we could deploy every continuous build to multiple
environments configured for different purposes, such as stress testing, fault
injection, DR failover etc. But we don’t. So we often have to settle for
continuous deployment to DEV to run through some basic scenarios, followed by
promotion to UAT to provide some stability testing, and thence to PROD.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Where sharing of production input sources
is possible this means is that our inputs are often the same as for production,
but naturally our outputs have to be different. But you don’t want to have to
configure each output folder separately, so you need some variable-based mechanism
to keep it manageable so that most settings are then derived, e.g. only the
root folder name changes, the relative child structure stays the same and
therefore does not require explicit configuration.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The Disaster Recovery (DR) environment is
an interesting special case because it should look and smell just like
production. A common technique for minimising configuration changes during a
failover is to use DNS Common Names (CNAMEs) for the important servers, but
that isn’t always foolproof. Whilst this means that in theory you should be
able to switch to DR solely through network infrastructure re-configuration, in
practice you will find not every system you depend on will be quite so diligent.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Per-Machine</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Next up are machine specific settings. Even
in a homogenous Windows environment you often have a mix of 64-bit and 32-bit
hardware, slightly different hard disk partitioning, amount of memory, CPUs,
etc. or different performance characteristics for different services. Big
corporations love their “standard builds” which largely helps minimises the
impact but even those change over time as the hardware and OS changes – just
look at where user data has been stored in Windows over the various releases.
The ever changing security landscape also means that best practices change and
these will, on occasion, have a knock-on effect on your system’s set-up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>By far the biggest use for per-machine
overrides I’ve found though is during development, i.e. when running on a
developer’s workstation. While unit testing makes a significant contribution to
the overall testing process you still need the ability to easily cobble
together a local sandbox in which you can do some integration testing. I’ve discovered
the hard way what happens when the DEV environment becomes a free-for-all – it
gets broken and then left to fester. I’ve found treating it with almost the
same respect as production pays dividends because, if the DEV environment is
stable (and running the latest code) you can often reduce the setup time for
your local integration testing sandbox by drawing on the DEV services instead
of having to run them all locally.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Per-Process-Type</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Virtually all processes in the system will
probably share the same basic configuration, but certain processes will have
specific tasks to do and so they may need to be reconfigured to work around
transient problems. One of the reasons for using lots of processes (that share
logic via libraries) is exactly to make configuration easier because you can
use the process name as a “configuration variable”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The command line is probably the default
mechanism most people think of when you want to control the behaviour of a
process, but I’ve found it’s useful to distinguish between task specific
parameters, which you’ll likely always be providing, and background parameters
that remain largely static. This means that when you use the “</span><code><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>--help</span></code><span lang=EN-GB>”
switch you are not inundated with pages of options. For example a process that
always needs an input file will likely take that on the command line, as it
might an (optional) output folder; but the database that provides all the
background data could well be defaulted using, say, an .ini file.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Per-User</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The final category is down to the user (or more
commonly the service account) under which the process runs. I’m not talking
about client-side behaviour which could well be entirely dynamic, but
server-side where you often run all your services under one or more special
accounts. There is often an element of crossover here with the environment as
there may be separate DEV, TEST and PROD service accounts to help with
isolation. Support is another scenario where the user account can come into
play as I may want to enable/disable certain features to help avoid tainting
the environment I’m inspecting, such as using a different logging
configuration.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Getting permissions granted is one of those
tasks that often gets forgotten until the last minute (unless DEV is treated
liked PROD which drives the requirement out early). Before you know it you
switch from DEV (where everyone has way too many rights) to UAT and you suddenly
find things don’t work. A number of times in the past I’ve worked on systems
where a developer’s account has been temporarily used to run a process in DEV
or UAT to keep things moving whilst the underlying change requests bounce
around the organisation. Naturally security is taken pretty seriously and so
permissions changes always seem to need three times as many signatures as other
requests; in the meantime though we are expected to keep development and
testing moving along.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Hierarchical Configuration</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Although most configuration differences
I’ve encountered tend to fall into one specific category per setting, there are
some occasions where I’ve had cause to need to override the same setting based
on two categories, say, environment <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i>
machine (or user <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i> process).
However, because the hardware and software is itself naturally partitioned (i.e.
environment/user) it’s usually been the same as only needing to override on the
latter (i.e. machine/process). For example if a few UAT and PROD servers had
half the <st1:stockticker w:st="on">RAM</st1:stockticker> of the others, then
the override could be applied at machine-level on just those boxes because the
servers are physically separated (the environment) as UAT and PROD services are
never installed on the same host.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>What this has all naturally lead to is a
hierarchical configuration mechanism, something like what .Net provides, but
where &lt;machine&gt; does not necessarily mean <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>all</i> software on that host, just my system components. It may also
take in multiple configuration providers, such as a database, .ini files, the registry,
command line, etc. With something like a database the problem of chickens-and-eggs
rears its head and so it can’t be a source for bootstrapping settings as you
need somewhere to configure a connection string to access it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>As an aside environment variables are one
technique I wouldn’t use by default to configure services on Windows. This is
because they are inherited from the parent process – Services.exe – and so any
change to the system environment variables requires it to be restarted, which
is essentially a reboot [KB].</span></p>

<h5><span lang=EN-GB>Hierarchical Files</span></h5>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The default file-based configuration
mechanism that .Net uses has only two levels of .config file, but it’s possible
to leverage the underlying technology and create your own chain of
configuration files. In the past I have exploited this mechanism so that on
start-up each process will go looking for these files in the assembly folder in
the following order:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><code><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>System.Global.config
<o:p></o:p></span></code></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><code><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>System<span
class=GramE>.&lt;</span>environment&gt;.config <o:p></o:p></span></code></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><code><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>System<span
class=GramE>.&lt;</span>machine&gt;.config <o:p></o:p></span></code></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><code><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>System<span
class=GramE>.&lt;</span>process&gt;.config <o:p></o:p></span></code></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><code><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>System<span
class=GramE>.&lt;</span>user&gt;.config <o:p></o:p></span></code></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Yes, this means that every process will hit
the file-system looking for up to 5 .config files, but in the grand scheme of
things the hit is minimal. In the past I have also allowed config settings and
the bootstrapping config filename to be overridden on the command line by using
a hierarchical command line handler that can process common settings. This has
been invaluable when you want to run the same process side-by-side during
support or debugging and you need slightly different configurations, such as
forcing them to write to different output folders.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Use Sensible Defaults</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It might appear from this article that I’m a
configuration nut. On the contrary, I like the ability to override settings
when it’s appropriate, but I don’t want to be forced to provide settings that
have an obvious default. I see little point in large configuration files full
of defaulted settings just because someone may need to tweak it, one day –
that’s what the source code and documentation is for.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I once worked on a system where all
configuration settings were explicit. This was intentional according to the
lead developer because you then knew what settings were being used without
having to rummage around the source code or find some (probably out-of-date)
documentation. I understand this desire but it made testing so much harder as
there was a single massive configuration object to bootstrap before any
testable code could run. It became a burden needing to provide a valid setting
for some obscure business rule when all I was trying to test were changes to
the low-level messaging layer.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Configuration File Formats</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I have a preference for simple string
key/value pairs for the configuration settings – the old fashioned Windows .ini
file format still provides one of the simplest formats. Yes, XML <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>may</i> be more flexible but it’s also considerably
more verbose. Also, once you get into hierarchical configurations (such as .Net
XML style .config files), its behaviour becomes unintuitive as you begin to
question whether blocks of settings are merged at the section level, or as individual
entries within each section. These little things just add to the burden of any integration/systems
testing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I mentioned configuration <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>variables</i> earlier and they make a big
difference during testing. You could specify, say, all your input folders
individually as absolute paths, but when they’re related that’s a pain when it
comes to environmental changes, e.g.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><code><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>[Feeds] <o:p></o:p></span></code></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><code><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>SystemX=\\Server\PROD\Imports\SystemX
<o:p></o:p></span></code></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><code><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>SystemY=\\Server\PROD\Imports\SystemY<br>
SystemZ=\\Server\PROD\Imports\SystemZ<o:p></o:p></span></code></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>One option would be to generate the final configuration
files from some sort of template, such as with a tool like SlowCheetah
[SlowCheetah], which could be done at compile time, package time or deployment
time. The source files could then be hierarchical in nature but flattened down
to a single deployable file.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>When there are many defaults and only a few
overrides following the hierarchical nature right through to the deployment
means that it’s easier to see what is overridden because it file only lists
exceptions. You can then use variables in the core settings and define them in
the list of exceptions, e.g.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><code><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>&lt;System.Global.config&gt;<o:p></o:p></span></code></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><code><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>[Variables] <o:p></o:p></span></code></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><code><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>FeedsRoot=%SharedData%\Imports
<o:p></o:p></span></code></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><code><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></code></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><code><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>[Feeds] <o:p></o:p></span></code></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><code><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>SystemX=%FeedsRoot%\SystemX
<o:p></o:p></span></code></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><code><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>SystemY=%FeedsRoot%\SystemY<o:p></o:p></span></code></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><code><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>SystemZ=%FeedsRoot%\SystemZ<o:p></o:p></span></code></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><code><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></code></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><code><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>&lt;System.PROD.config&gt;<o:p></o:p></span></code></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><code><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>[Variables] <o:p></o:p></span></code></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><code><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:10.0pt'>SharedData=\\Server\PROD
<o:p></o:p></span></code></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The set of variables don’t just have to be
custom ones, you can also chain onto the underlying environment variables
collection so that you can use standard paths such as %TEMP% and %ProgramFiles%
when necessary.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Summary</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>This article took a look at the differences
between configuring a complex system for use in production and the many other
environments in which it needs to operate, such as development and testing. We
identified a number of patterns that help describe why we might need to
configure the system in different ways and formulated a hierarchy that can be
used to refine settings in a consistent manner. Finally we looked at how
variables can be used to exploit the commonality across settings to further
reduce the points of configuration to a bare minimum.</span></p>
