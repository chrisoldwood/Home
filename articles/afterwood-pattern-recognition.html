<p class=MsoNormal>Pattern matching is a concept traditionally associated with
functional programming but the more I think about my day-to-day job in the
world of software development the more I realise that pattern matching in
general is something which pervades everything from working with the codebase, to
processes, and ultimately the people in the organisation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was reminded again recently that we don’t all see the same
patterns in code. (Before going on we need to stop and remind ourselves of Ralph
Waldo Emerson's famous quote “A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little
minds” but this not about being right or wrong, just a reflection on the
disparity.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I discovered that someone had inserted 7DY (a financial
period, aka “tenor”, representing 7 days) between 0DY and 0YR instead of
between 6DY and 1WK in this sequence below, and that threw me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>0DY, 0YR, 4DY, 5DY, 6DY, 1WK, 30DY, 1MO, …</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, I should point out that each entry was on a separate
line as they were the keys of a dictionary, but they were still on consecutive
lines. In the past even alphabetised lists have not been immune to seemingly
random insertions, and they have slipped through the review process too because
diff tools only show a few lines of context which incentivises you to largely
ignore the wider context unless you go out of your way. (If it <i>really</i>
matters, enforce it in code or with a test.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In essence you could consider the first choice of insertion
point a <i>local</i> maximum (between days and years, albeit both zero) whereas
the second one might be more like a <i>global</i> maximum (between six days and
one week – yes, finance is weird). And that, I think, is one difference that
distinguishes programmers along their journey to mastery – they typically go looking
for the global maxima rather than settling for the first local maxima they find.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we start to zoom out of the codebase we see patterns at
different levels – statements, functions, classes, components, systems, etc.
For some reason we refer to small-scale patterns as mere “idioms” whereas once
they get large enough, they get promoted to Design Pattern™ status. (Although
ironically the original design patterns made famous by the Gang of Four were
relegated to “idiom” by many commentators.) In the past I’ve quipped that many
interfaces I see are more <i>adhesive</i> than cohesive as people have a
tendency to just stick a new method on the end instead of looking for a “more logical”
place to insert it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the subject of terminology, a favoured pattern-oriented
approach to software development goes by the moniker Convention over
Configuration. The idea is that it should be easier to follow an existing
pattern and have the right thing magically happen, than be given free rein and
then need to explicitly link the artefacts together. Some conventions, e.g.
putting all source files under a “src” folder to avoid you needing to add each
filename to a project  / makefile / build script, span technologies and helps
you fall into the Pit of Success. Other conventions, which typically involve
using reflection and adhering to seemingly arbitrary naming rules are less
obvious. In the past I’ve discovered tests that weren’t run because they only
started with “test” and not “test_” (the former style is the convention in more
than one popular test framework, but not the one we were using.) Likewise, I’ve
discovered entire test assemblies being missed out of the CI pipeline due to
being <i>un</i>conventional. Typically, this then begs the question about how someone
could write tests and not notice that they weren’t being run.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I think this is another area where those of us further along
their programming journey begin to explore patterns outside the codebase and
architecture – people and their behaviours. For example, I once noticed that a
certain member of the team would consistently submit merge requests with a
large commit history with tiny changes and typically the word “fixed” in the
message. When reviewing, it’s common to only consider the final outcome of the entire
changeset and not the journey, so you probably miss the signs buried in the
history. In this instance what was missing was taking the time to review their
code properly and run the entire test suite <i>before</i> pushing the branch thereby
creating an excessive amount of context switching.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A few decades earlier I remember joining a team to help
improve the scalability and reliability of a distributed system. One of my
first jobs was to deal with a serious memory leak which actually turned out to
be a considerable number of smaller leaks – forgetting to mark the destructor
of a base class as <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>virtual</span>.
While I could have just fixed the leaks and moved on, I wondered if there was a
pattern there. It turned out they were all written by the same person, and
although no longer in the team, they were still at the company and only a few
rows away. They were very appreciative of my discovery and for taking the time
to talk to them about the mistake. (Sadly, not everyone there was quite so
happy with my ability to spot suspect code patterns and use the version control
tool to work backwards to identity the author.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monitoring systems is another area where our pattern
recognition abilities get put to the test as we scour over log files and
performance graphs looking for the clues that caused the system to behave in an
odd way. The trick here, like elsewhere, is not to fall foul of the old adage
about correlation being mistaken for causation. Of course, before you can spot
a system that’s behaving weirdly you have to know what it looks like when it’s
behaving <i>normally</i> which likely entails spotting a different kind of pattern.
This is why I like to write-up postmortems, it’s hard to spot a pattern if you
don’t have the history to draw upon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cohesion, whether it be in  the code, design, system,
processes, or organisation is an enabler for successful delivery, but it
requires us to stand back to see the bigger picture and course-correct when
things have gone wayward. Inside the chaos there may well be order fighting to
get out, but only if you go looking for it.</p>
