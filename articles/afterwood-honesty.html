<p class=MsoNormal>As a child I struggled with honesty; often shooting from the
hip meant I never really considered the consequences of my actions and so found
myself facing the ire of my parents more frequently than I should have. It was
never anything serious but I began to find it easy to explain why anything that
went wrong was never entirely my fault. I suspect the innocence of childhood
gave me the benefit of the doubt more often than I deserved too. Fortunately my
parents did a good enough job that my moral compass ensured I never strayed far
from the straight and narrow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Software development has always appeared more forgiving than
many other jobs. In my early days as a programmer there were a million
different reasons why things never went smoothly. For example the very
environment we worked in was brittle – you would routinely have to restart
16-bit Windows and pray your hard disk was still intact. I’ve lost many hours
trying to debug even user-mode applications that would cause the earlier
versions of Windows to crash. Then you have compilers with code generation bugs
which you needed to work around by writing the same code in a different way.
And then there’s the language itself with its many traps and pitfalls for the
unwary programmer that resulted in “undefined behaviour” (UB) which you often
found out the hard way. Add to this the ambiguities of natural language leading
to poorly specified requirements and you’ll find it’s fairly easy to avoid
having the finger pointed directly at yourself as the root cause of most problems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My safe little bubble eventually burst one afternoon courtesy
of a support incident at a large financial organisation. I was genuinely
surprised when a colleague quietly asked me why I had just rebooted our system’s
main servers in the production environment. He confirmed that he’d double
checked the security logs and, yes, my login was in there as being the
instigator of the machine restarts, which seemed pretty conclusive. It didn’t
take long before I’d realised what had happened and how the mistake had been made.
Yes, I had a pretty good clue where things had gone wrong but ultimately the
mistake was mine. My stomach churned as I waited for the fallout. You often hear
tales about how people have been marched straight off the premises for
misconduct and can’t help but wonder if there’s a grain of truth somewhere in
those friend-of-a-friend stories. Being a contractor and fairly new to the
company didn’t feel like it was exactly going to help my cause either.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Of course nothing happened. In retrospect my mistake was
insignificant compared to the many others that occurred around me and, whilst
there was a loss of service as everything slowly came back up and recovered,
the actual loss to the business was probably less than the time taken to work
out what it would have cost. Naturally the first code change I made straight after
was to my custom admin tool so that machine names starting with a P and D were
more easily discernible – bright red for the former, something contrasting for
the latter. Oh, and it popped up a warning message too, for good measure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The notion of holding a post-mortem is not a new one
although the emphasis on it being a <i>blameless</i> post-mortem seems to have
gained more recognition in recent years. My earliest recollection of the idea
of post-mortems (outside the medical ones on TV shows like Quincy) was through
the embedded software column in Dr Dobbs Journal, written by Ed Nisley. NASA
had started making their post-mortems publicly available and so Ed would
publish extracts in his column along with some additional commentary. I’ve
never worked in that kind of environment but certainly marvelled at the
ingenuity it creates working within such constraints. It would be easy to laugh
at some of the extremely costly and yet seemingly trivial mistakes they’ve made
in the past but the main take-away for me was always that if the super-smart
people at somewhere like NASA couldn’t get this software development lark right
all the time, then what chance did I stand?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reading about the recent major outage at a British airline
and the apparent scapegoating of a system administrator reminded me of some of
my own little mishaps and how they had been dealt with. I’ve clearly been fortunate
enough to have worked within teams where the level of trust and respect both
within the team and around it are sufficiently high that the occasional mistake
is dealt with appropriately. One can only assume that senior managers and shareholders
are after a scalp when something of that magnitude goes awry and therefore it
takes real courage to stand up and blame the process that let this happen
rather than single out the person who was likely the victim of a weak process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The prime directive, which is read out at the start of a
team’s retrospective, is a very clear statement which attempts to try and make
the team comfortable so they can get to the business of improving the process
they use, rather than blame the people themselves for their actions. Martin
Fowler has suggested in the past (based on the work of Pat Kua) how important reading
this statement has become, as repeatedly hearing it could potentially change
the culture of the team though the physiological effect known as priming.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This also ties in very nicely with “psychological safety”
which Google’s recent project Aristotle [1] managed to bolster with some qualitative
data. This is nothing entirely new though as “safety” also features in the
lower layers of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs which he published back in the late
1940’s and has no doubt been the subject of many other research projects in the
intervening years. What probably caused Google’s project Aristotle to surface
on my (and many other programmers) radar was no doubt down to the workforce
studied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The TL;DR of that research appears to be that we are at our
happiest when we work with nice people, although I’m sure it’s highly
disingenuous to try and distil it to such a simplistic outcome. I don’t think
I’ll ever truly get over the small amount of fear I feel when administering a
production system but I also think that may be a healthy attitude, to some
degree, to ensure I’m not reckless through complacency. Either way as long as any
fear we do feel is one of our own self-restraint and not out of a lack of
process, and subsequent retribution, then our productivity will remain at its
highest.</p>
