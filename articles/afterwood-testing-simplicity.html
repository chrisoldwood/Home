<p class=MsoNormal>Einstein famously told us to keep things as simple as
possible, and no simpler. Hence, you’d think that being presented with a small snippet
of simple code would generate a flurry of correct answers along with lots of
metaphorical shrugging of shoulders and cries of “meh?” as people wonder what
all the fuss is about.  Jason Gorman, someone who specialises in training &amp;
coaching software teams, recently posted the following question on his various
social media accounts [1][2]:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Quick experiment: what's the expected result that's been
blanked out in this test code?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>[</span><span
style='font-family:"Tahoma",sans-serif'>&#65279;</span><span style='font-family:
"Courier New"'>Test]<br>
public void FundsTransferDebitsPayer()<br>
{<br>
  // Arrange<br>
  Account payer = new Account();<br>
  payer.Credit(1000.0);<br>
  Account payee = new Account();<br>
<br>
  // Act<br>
  payer.Transfer(250.0, payee);<br>
<br>
  //Assert<br>
  Assert.That(payer.Balance, Is.EqualTo(_____));<br>
}</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He doesn’t say what programming language this is written in
but it’s fair to say it’s either Java or C# -- a pair that are so similar these
days they are easier to mix-up than Pluto and Goofy, or The Munsters and The
Addams family. Either way, both these languages generally hold very few
surprises, or dark corners that could lead to the pit of undefined behaviour. For
those playing along at home, the answer really is just 750.0.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My own response was a somewhat guarded “750, right?”,
followed by a flippant suggestion that if this was an interview there would
almost certainly be some gotcha that I hadn’t accounted for. There wasn’t, this
time, but <i>nobody</i> ever posts a snippet of code on social media that does
exactly what it says on the tin, so is it any wonder that nearly every reply
was caveated in some way? We programmers can be such a jaded bunch at times,
our bodies metaphorically covered from head-to-toe in scar tissue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Naturally I blame all those ridiculous interviews we go
through where the apparent goal is not to hire someone capable of doing the job
but to allow the interviewer to show the candidates how clever <i>they</i> are.
If this code snippet was presented in a code review or generated during a pair
/ ensemble session I would hardly think twice about it. (That’s not entirely
true because of the apparent ill-advised use of floating-point numbers for
monetary values instead of using <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>decimal</span>
in C#, <span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>BigDecimal</span> in Java, scaled
integer, etc. but that wasn’t the point of the question.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another side-effect of unrealistic interviews is that it
makes it much harder to convince candidates that <i>your</i> interview process
is not like that, and any code you ask them to write really should be simple.
One client I worked for adopted a variation of Fizz Buzz to help separate “the
wheat from the chaff” and, despite trying their best to convince candidates
that they were after simple, boring code, candidates still felt the need to
create an entire rules engine instead of writing a few “<span style='font-family:
"Courier New"'>if</span>” statements. Using pair programming as an interview
format [3] is also a technique I picked up there, and being present gives you
an opportunity to ram home the message that KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid!) is the
expected mode of operation. Also, asking candidates for examples of
refactorings they’ve done in the past has proved to be a useful seam to get a
feel for what <i>they</i> might consider as unnecessary complex and consequently
what their idea of “simpler” is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many of the teams I’ve worked in over the years have
generally been of the “you build it, you run it” stance and so your current
teammates provide a useful barometer for what passes as “simple enough”. In a
few cases though I’ve worked in The Enterprise™ where they have a different
approach to maintenance, one where they hire a bunch of experienced developers
to create a new service or application and then, when the first release is done,
they hand it over to “the support team” for any future bug fixes or enhancements.
What surprised me was that this team mostly spends their time doing system
administration but then only gets to don their software developer hat
occasionally.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This difference in maintenance approach started to make me
consider the readership of my code more deeply than usual and this popular
quote from <i>The Elements of Programming Style</i> took on a new perspective:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a
program in the first place. So if you're as clever as you can be when you write
it, how will you ever debug it?” – Brian Kernighan</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Consequently, patterns and idioms which, up to that point I
assumed to be perfectly acceptable, I now felt less comfortable using and
started questioning whether I was carrying over anachronisms instead of adopting
more modern idioms that would make the code more accessible to this different
audience. For example, as an industry we now discourage people from writing manual
loops, and so I’d posit that a retry loop in C# of the form:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>var attempt = 5;<br>
while(attempt-- &gt; 0) { … }</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is now becoming trickier to reason about than:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>foreach(var attempt
in Enumerable.Range(1, 5)) { … }</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>when it comes to mentally checking the maximum number of
times around the loop. While the former technique might have been inherited
from C by several popular languages, that doesn’t guarantee universal
comprehension. It might be marginally less typing, and closer to the metal, but
as we embrace more functional idioms the latter style of code is becoming the
new norm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the other hand, am I falling foul of Einstein’s advice
and heading into oversimplification territory and as a consequence verging on
patronisation? Can code become <i>too</i> simple?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What I liked about the replies to Jason’s experiment was
seeing people answer their own questions about the code without realising it.
As Alex Horne often says to contestants in this situation on Taskmaster “all
the information is on the task”, though in Jason’s example it’s in the names of
the test, class, methods, and variables. Any other assumptions, like the
default balance being 0.0, feel like a no-brainer too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At some point we have to put our spade down and trust that
the reader will engage their own brain. The trouble seems to be that the reader
doesn’t always trust us to hold up our end of the bargain.</p>
