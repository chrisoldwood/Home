people say “bring a notebook” they mean “bring a laptop”, not “bring a

is your favourite UML tool?” I swear by Crayola -- @jasongorman</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>First thing in the morning at work, after
turning on my machine and taking a few gulps of coffee, the next thing I do is
get out my notepad and pen. Despite all the advances in hardware and software
and the plethora of apps on the market designed to aid in every office task, I
still regularly use the old fashioned method of pen and paper.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>TODOs</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>By far the main use of my notebook is a
list of things that either needs to be done or have caught my attention and so <i>possibly</i>
deserve further thought or scrutiny at a later date. Sadly, when it comes to
remembering what I’m (supposed to be) doing I’m like the proverbial goldfish –
I find it all too easy to head off on a tangent and then lose focus on what
really matters at that point. Although I have the ability to remember significant
amounts code I have written in my programming career I still can’t make it to
the top of the stairs at home without remembering what it was I went up there…
oh, look shiny thing!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The sorts of things I end up making a note
of are the questions (or quite possibly the WTFs [1]) that form in my mind as
I’m working with both my own, and other people’s code. I have yet to work in an
environment where code reviews happen formally, regularly and cover 100% of the
codebase. Instead I tend to see what’s changed when I update my local copy,
mostly out of self interest to see where any instability might arise, but also
because I’m just a nosy person that likes to know what’s going on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Most times the kind of things that raise
questions are fairly isolated and so can often be resolved pretty quickly,
especially if the other developer is happy to take it up there and then. The
alternative is a wider issue that involves looking across the entire codebase
for similar cases. For example, catching <i>every</i> type of exception, i.e. </span><code><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt'>catch(…)</span></code><span lang=EN-GB> in
C++ or </span><code><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt'>catch(Exception)</span></code><span
lang=EN-GB> in C#, is a code smell for me when not done on a module boundary
and so I’d reserve a little time to review the codebase and look for similar
occurrences. I probably wouldn’t want to take that on immediately, but I also
don’t want to forget it either.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Naturally when trying to work in an agile
kind of way one is often mindful of eliminating any waste, and these little
nuggets of work are no exception. My notebook acts as a temporary store to
record my observations, but at a later date they can be handled in a variety of
ways. It could be that someone else has picked up on it too and it’s all
resolved so I can just scribble out my note. Or perhaps what I initially
thought was a smell turned out to be insignificant after all. At the other end
of the scale are the items that have since mushroomed into a much larger task
and so needs to be placed on the backlog as a formal piece of work – subject to
further prioritisation of course. In between these two are the little things
that aren’t really important enough to distract me now but I’m not quite sure
whether there is any real substance to them – superficially they might seem to
have value, but perhaps the cost of change could only be justified as part of
some other work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There was an interesting question raised on
 accu-general a few weeks back about tracking new tests that spring to mind
whilst writing existing ones. In this particular instance I will use the code
to record my thoughts, perhaps as a simple comment or more likely as a stub test
case that shows up “inconclusive” to make it more visible. If the test is for
another class outside the scope of the current feature it goes in the notebook
as that’s probably a can of worms just waiting to be opened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>In essence the moment when I commit my
changes is a natural barrier for me because it signifies the publishing of a
single atomic, tested change in the codebase. If something needs to happen
before the next commit I might as well just get on and do it. Otherwise it goes
in the book and I can recalibrate my workload again afterwards. Assuming I
don’t break the build of course…</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Diagrams</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>When I first discovered UML and started
playing with a couple of Enterprise UML tools I, like many others, thought this
was going to be a Big Thing. Of course it hasn’t really panned out that way, but
what I have got from it is a common vocabulary to use when knocking up
diagrams. Martin Fowler uses the term “sketches” in his UML Distilled book
which I prefer as it takes a lot of the formality out of their use and recasts
them as what they most usefully are – a conduit for further discussion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>What I particularly like about diagrams
drawn in my notebook is that they also contain all the little amendments and
annotations that occurred during the discussion. While the end result might be
a nice snapshot of the destination, the journey often says far more about the
contention and ideas that were explored along the way. Seeing the furiously
drawn circles and underlines again is a great reminder on where the points of
contention were and consequently where future confusion may lie.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Then there is just the immediacy of being
able to flick back a few pages to the diagram in the middle of a discussion.
Nothing kills the flow more than sitting, idly waiting for someone to hunt
around in their emails looking for a picture. You could of course just draw it
again, perhaps slightly differently this time so that the perspective changes.
That in itself is a smell – constantly referring to or drawing the same picture
– as it might mean the design is unintuitive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>If you’re going to knock up a sketch it’s
better still if you have a couple of different coloured pens to hand too. Even
just using black and red gives you a way to call out the more important
aspects. Given the wage of an average programmer it costs very little to buy
your own set of pens. You might need to keep them in a locked drawer though if
you ever want them to remain in your possession for longer than a few days!</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Support</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Outside the usual run-of-the-mill
development notes are the support ones. When in the heat of battle as I’m
trying to resolve a production issue I need somewhere to jot down my
observations. Often these are events that come from log files or specific data items
like a unique customer ID. They often exist only transiently, appearing perhaps
within the command line in my shell or a SQL query window. After the dust has
settled I like to write-up a short post-mortem that explains the problem and
contains the key data items in case a similar problem occurs again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Anything that happens out of the ordinary
in production has the hallmark of an edge case that will likely feed into some
later development, such as a fix that requires a specific test case. Whilst a
post-mortem email is readily searchable the margins of my notebook are often a
quicker source when looking for some “interesting data” to put a test case
together.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-GB>Post Script</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>My need to write things down was borne out
of the frustration of forgetting things which had the undesirable consequence
of me keep going off at a tangent and therefore disregarding the real priority.
Sadly it took me a <i>very</i> long time to realise that the act of writing
down notes was what mattered, not that I had actually written them. It also
probably explains why I can remember much of the code I have written. This
turns out to be a well known phenomenon [2] that is possibly even more
effective when handwritten than typed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The most important part of this discovery though
affects my personal life. Where before I used to rely, and fail miserably, on
trying to remember the hints my wife would drop for her birthday and Christmas
presents; now I surreptitiously jot them down on my smart phone under the guise
of sending another banal tweet. The old fashioned approach definitely works
better for me in the office but in the great outdoors I’m happy to bow down to the
convenience of modern technology.</span></p>
