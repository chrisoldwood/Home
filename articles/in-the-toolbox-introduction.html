<div class=Section1>

<h1 align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>In The Tool Box –
Introduction</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>For many programmers their bread and butter
involves slaving over code written in a general purpose language, such as C++,
C# or Java. These all require a text editor for modifying the program source
code and a compiler for turning that into something the machine can actually
use. Those working in the realm of the dynamic languages have a similar
toolset, albeit with an interpreter or JIT compiler to turn their masterpiece
into boring old machine code.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>And for some this is where it ends too. The
testing, deployment, documentation &amp; project management fairies all take
over now to finish off those other menial tasks. After all, the hard work’s
been done, right?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>As the software systems we are trying to
create get more and more complex, so does the number and type of tools we need
to use to get the job done. In some big corporations there are teams dedicated
to testing and deployment, but that still leaves an awful lot that we need to
cover ourselves. In the smaller shops you’ve got all that along with painting your
office once in a while too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>We should always strive to use “the right
tool for the job”, but that doesn’t mean that we have to buy an all-singing,
all-dancing bug tracking system if our development practices ensure that our
bug count remains low – a spreadsheet may well be “the right tool”. At least, it
might for now. Later, if the spreadsheet becomes unwieldy (hopefully due a high
demand for more useful features, not bugs) we can investigate alternatives then.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The problems we need to solve outside of
our core code-writing activity are often varied. After the text editor (nay,
IDE) and compiler (which is often chosen for us) the Version Control System
probably comes next in the list as we need to manage our code-lines as we
checkout, commit, branch, merge and spelunk on a regular basis. From there it’s
a short hop to the Continuous Integration server that automates a set of build
scripts and ad-hoc tools that even Heath Robinson would be proud of. Deployment
is probably a similar affair. Even if “all” you turn out is an .MSI something
has to produce that, and you’ll need to track your builds and symbols somewhere
just in case a bug shows up in the field.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Oh, yes, and there is testing too. Unit
testing forms the basis of many team’s testing strategy, with integration and
system scale testing thrown in for good measure. Once you reach the outer
layers of the system there are a plethora of tools to help with those really
gnarly problems, like testing UI’s and web services. Although you will probably
strive to create automated tests where possible, there is still a place for
manual testing and that must involve some sort of tooling too, even though you
might not think of it that way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>If your product is a system composed of many
moving parts, such as for batch processing or a service, you’ve also got the
support and monitoring sides to consider. The distinction between an “operator”
and “developer” are so blurred now that you might have to do a spot of log
trawling and live debugging followed by the creation of a patch that needs to
be rolled out post-haste. Getting from “problem discovered” to “fix deployed”
could well see the use of a tool chest that would make an electrician feel
under-equipped. If it’s really serious there might be some major “glue”
required to hold the system together until the correct action can be
implemented, tested and rolled-out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>And that’s what this column wants to be
about – how people solve the problems that allow us to do the other thing we
actually think we’re being paid to do. Any discussion of text editors is
clearly out of scope on the basis that it’s only mildly less contentious than
discussing tabs and spaces. Similarly it’s not an excuse to rope in 3<sup>rd</sup>
parties to write some “Advertorials” either. It’s a chance for jobbing programmers
to open up their own tool boxes and let the C Vu readership know what kinds of
cool stuff they have in there and how they use it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The good thing about metaphorical tool
boxes is that they are TARDIS like in nature and so can contain everything from
the svelte and simple TR through to the powerful and mind-bending GIT. Yes, we can
all read the manual on how TR and GIT <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>might</i>
be used, but what’s more important is how do <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>you</i> use it? Why do you use it? What are some of the trade-offs that
caused you to choose, say, the monkey wrench over the spanner? The aim is to
try and convert some of that Unconscious Incompetence into Conscious Incompetence
[1], or better yet into Conscious Competence by exposing new tools, or just
reminding some of us about the old ones that are collecting dust because we’ve
forgotten about them. Better yet how have you managed to make up for the
shortfall in one tool’s feature set by using another?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Clearly the classic UNIX commands such as
SED and AWK provide a huge source of inspiration, but I’m also hoping we can
look further a field to the less obvious. For instance, have you ever treated
.csv files and Excel spreadsheets as database tables to aid in testing? Or, how
do you generate a unique build number? What about the kinds of information you
put on a dashboard for your support team?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Sadly the one-way communication of these
pages will likely only wet your appetite and so you’ll need somewhere else to
go to delve into the finer points of how, what, why, when and where. For that
there is always “<st1:PersonName w:st="on">accu-general</st1:PersonName>” – the
virtual coffee shop come mailing list that never actually serves coffee, but is
frequented by craftsman of the programming trade who are always all too eager
to share their opinions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>So, pop open that tool box have a rummage
around and see what interesting stuff you can find.</span></p>
