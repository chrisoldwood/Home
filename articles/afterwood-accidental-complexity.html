</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>Back in 1986 Fred Brooks published the seminal essay <i>No
Silver Bullet: Essence and Accident in Software Engineering</i> in which he
introduced us to the idea that there are two different kinds of complexity which
software engineers need to deal with. The first is “essential complexity” which
is complexity that is inherent in the problem being solved. Before we can solve
the problem we humans need to understand the problem domain and model it before
we can think about how we’re going to represent it in the solution domain. In
the essay Brooks argues that there is little to really help us quickly get into
and understand the true essence of the problems we try to solve through
software. Yes, there have been some advances but nothing stellar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second kind of complexity which Brooks described he
coined “accidental complexity”. This exists in the solution domain and is the
complexity which exists as a by-product of the processes, tools and
technologies we use to solve our customer’s problems. This kind of complexity
could be perceived as being a problem of our own making as the programming languages
and tools we use are imperfect and therefore imprecise. These are the silver
bullets which the essay is referring to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unfortunately the choice of the term “accidental” became a
poor one as it was often interpreted incorrectly. In his follow-up essay almost
10 years later, <i>No Silver Bullet Refired</i>, he describes how it was often
treated in the sense of “misfortune” rather than its alternative meaning of
“incidental”. As such many rebuttals targeted the apparent incompetence of
programmers instead of the imperfections in the tooling which missed the point
of the original essay.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In theory as we make technological advances we should be
reducing the degree of accidental complexity – the ability to represent our
solution for the problem in computerised form – and instead spend more time focusing
on tackling the essential complexity. The growth of the Agile movement which
puts an emphasis on trying to ensure we “build the right thing” before wasting
time “building the wrong thing, in the right way” has also meant that the
essential complexities are starting to get more of a look-in before we get
bogged down in the coding. This is probably not surprising given that the latter
part of <i>No Silver Bullet</i> lists the use of “incremental development” and
the metaphor to “grow, not build” software as probably the most promising
approach to tackling the problem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>No Silver Bullet</i> was added to the Anniversary Edition
of his book <i>The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering</i> which
was published 20 years later in 1995. The first essay in that book, and one I’m
personally very fond of, is The Tar Pit. It’s one of the shorter ones, weighing
in at just 6 pages, and provides a brief introduction to the rest of book by
exploring what systems programming is all about. Along the way he looks at both
the “joys” and the “woes” of the craft and suggests that for most people “the
joys far outweigh the woes” which I reckon most programmers would find little
trouble agreeing with, even if on certain days it feels like the latter might
be true.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And so with the lay of the land firmly established I feel
comfortable in making my confession – it’s the accidental complexity that I
find exciting. That’s right, what floats my particular boat is solving the
problems which shouldn’t really exist but do because of those imperfections in
the tooling we use. The Internet is awash with advice on how we should get
better at understanding our customer’s needs and solve their problems more
efficiently but quite frankly that’s just not as interesting to me as trying to
dig yourself out of a technical hole which either you (or your predecessor) got
you into in the first place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That doesn’t mean I actively go out of my way to be obtuse
or pick technologies that are unsuitable purely for the purposes of
self-gratification – on the contrary I still want to be professional and do the
best job I can – it’s just I personally often find more pleasure solving the
problems in the solution domain than solving the actual customer’s problem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One example of this would be the war stories that
programmers like to share over a pint or two in the bar at a conference. The
ones I’m most fond of hearing or reading about (and sharing) are those that
involve one person’s struggle against the technology. There are so many
wonderful tales about how people have managed to bend, twist and generally
contort one tool to make it do something it was never intended to. In <i>An
Introduction to General Systems Thinking</i> Gerry Weinberg suggests that you
don’t really know a tool until you’ve abused it at least three times, so
perhaps there is a rite of passage where we have to embrace the gnarly problems
to truly grasp the very nature of accidental complexity so that we can try to
elude it in the future. As an aside that book was originally published at the
same time as <i>The Mythical Man Month</i> (and 10 years before <i>No Silver
Bullet</i>).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My current best efforts to explain these pangs of guilt come
from Vivek Singh (@petmongrels) who recently tweeted “Programmer Stack Envy – A
belief that work at a lower level in the stack is intellectually more
challenging than at one’s own level”. I know that when I leave the ACCU
Conference every year I am in awe of many of the people attending and the
things they’ve accomplished, especially as the C++ language grows ever more
complex with each new standard. But I wonder how many of those people are also suffering
from a form of Stockholm syndrome and are in it largely because it <i>is</i>
complex – an enigma to be solved in its own right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Secretly I hope there will never be a silver bullet because
when that day comes I fear it’s the day the fun goes out of programming.</p>
