<h1 align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>In The Toolbox -
Feature Tracking</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>A common question that comes up on the <st1:PersonName
w:st="on">accu-general</st1:PersonName> mailing list is about the tools teams can
use to track the list of features being implemented for their product.
Depending on the size of the team, the maturity of the product and the
enterprise-ness of the organisation I’ve used a number a tools in the past.
Other factors that have affected my opinion of the usefulness of a tool have
often revolved around how it gels with the other tools such as the version
control system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>For my own personal set of libraries and
applications I naturally have very simple needs. Generally speaking all I want
is a one line description of a bug or feature. Consequently every library and
application has a simple text file called TODO.txt that is (often) an unordered
list of features. One of the good things about keeping this file in the repo
alongside the source code is that it changes as each feature is implemented.
Generating the release notes is then as simple as picking out all the diffs of
that file since the last <span class=GramE>release</span> label.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>More recently I’ve started using an online
service (GitHub) to host my source code repos. Being a service aimed at project
hosting, each repo automatically gains an Issues database and Wiki. The
database of issues provides the next step up from a simple text file as you can
track the status of features in more detail, such as who’s assigned to it,
which release it’s destined for, etc. Because it’s integrated with the source
code repo including a number such as “#42” in the commit message creates a link
in the GitHub UI to the issue with the same number which is good for software
archaeology later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>At the other end of the spectrum are the <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Enterprise</st1:City></st1:place> scale products
that try to cater for big teams with heavy development processes that feel the
need to try and track lots of “important” metrics about each feature. They often
come as part of a big suite that plays on their integration as a selling point.
For example it’s possible (and incredibly annoying) that Rational’s ClearCase
version control product supports triggers that ensure a change can’t be
committed unless it’s linked to an item in ClearQuest, their feature tracking
database.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It’s a noble pursuit to try and ensure that
every code change, and therefore every commit, is related in some way to a
formally tracked feature, whether instigated by the business or the development
team itself, as that helps keep everyone honest. However I find enforcing that
kind of policy increases the pain of checking in out-of-band changes, such as
to the build process, and only succeeds in enticing developers to bundle
unrelated changes instead. If the tool makes adding a new feature request
tedious then it’s not going to be used the way you might prefer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Outside the realm of dedicated 3<sup>rd</sup>
party feature tracking products are the home grown alternatives. Naturally
Excel, the Swiss-army knife of the corporate world, has been pressed into
service on many an occasion. Despite it being painful to enter or read blocks
of text with more than a couple of words, its ability to easily produce charts
seems to be a big consolation prize in some circles. The agile project
manager’s fascination with burn-down charts and the like might fuel this
choice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>What is probably the most derided part of
the Microsoft Office suite – the Access database tool – is far more suited to
the task, or at least was a decade or so ago. The only time I’ve ever actually created
a database in Access was to knock up a simple bug tracking database for a very
small team I was in. I’d seen someone do it before at another site I’d worked at
and when the team grew large enough for the single-user problems to start
becoming a drag it was easy to <span class=GramE>migrate</span> the underlying
database engine to something more heavy-duty, like SQL Server. With the
plethora of free options available today the days of writing your own issue
tracker have almost certainly long gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>In more recent times I’ve had the pleasure
of using another of the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Enterprise</st1:City></st1:place>
favourites – JIRA. I appear to have been quite lucky in that my team were using
it how they wanted to, rather than how the project manager might want to. This
meant we kept the ceremony fairly low by only tracking features at a high-ish
level, linking them where appropriate and introducing sub-tasks when the larger
features spanned multiple releases. JIRA can parse the check-in comments to
relate source changes to a feature and supports links and attachments which are
useful for relating associated documentation, such as design notes, email
discussions, manual test cases, etc. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>At the TICOSA conference [1] I mentioned in
the last edition of this column [2] there was an interesting question about
where to store the supporting documentation for a feature. Whilst the code
might be a good place to document some specific details about the current
implementation, it isn’t necessarily the best place to “Record Your Rationale”
[3]. For this a wiki might be more appropriate or, if the document requires
some richer content such as UML sketches, then storing them in the repo itself
in a separate docs folder also keeps them close to hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The last 12 months has seen me working on a
number of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on"><span class=GramE>greenfield</span></st1:City></st1:place>
projects. Our very small team only needed a simple tool that would allow easy
manipulation of stories rather than containing any notably lengthy text. In each
case we used Trello and found it to be more than adequate. In fact after being
forced briefly to use an in-house SharePoint-based imitation we soon realised
how much we missed it! The text in cards can be written using Markdown for a
little extra spice, can contain attachments, and checklists which are an
excellent way to tick off the “done, done” criteria. Cards also have a unique
number which can be referenced in the commit messages. On one project board we
had a column named after each release version and using the JSON export feature
of Trello and JQ (a JSON command-line query tool) I produced some release notes
automatically based on the card number and title.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Whilst a project manager’s perspective of a
feature tracking tool will likely be biased towards prioritisation and
progress, as a developer I find I have different perspectives depending on the
state of the feature. Prior to implementation I also want to know what the most
important feature is along with details of acceptance criteria, etc. Post
implementation I’m often looking for a way to trace a change in the source code
back out to the driver for it so that I can better understand its context. This
helps makes subsequent changes a little safer, especially when tests are scarce
such as in legacy codebases. Sometimes, such as when a serious piece of
technical debt has been accrued, I raise a ticket and embed the ticket number directly
in the code to make it easier for a future maintenance programmer to track down
the supporting notes in case I’m not around when they finally decide to pay it
back.</span></p>
