<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>This year’s ACCU conference (my fourth) was
always going to be a little bit different because <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>this year</i> I was going to be speaking. That meant no stupid late
nights staying up in the bar chatting with my fellow ACCU members and other like
minded individuals about programming because I was a professional and I had a
job to do…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I arrived on the Tuesday evening just in
time for the obligatory visit to Chutneys - an Indian restaurant in the centre
of town. Many of the usual suspects were already there and it took no time at
all to slip into idle chat about what we’ve all been up to since we sat in the
same restaurant a year ago. Then it was back to the bar and a chance to catch
up with the late arrivals and gatecrash a few conversations in an attempt to do
a little networking before a nice early night. What a ridiculous notion. Of
course I ended up in the bar until <st1:time Hour="4" Minute="0" w:st="on">4 am</st1:time>
in a discussion about equality and value identity – John Lakos was there!
Still, I wasn’t on until Friday afternoon so there was plenty of time to recover.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The opening keynote on Wednesday morning
was from Giles Colborne, titled Advanced Simplicity. As someone who is a
backroom boy these days I don’t spend any time doing UI work, but the talk
seemed to transcend that and provided perfect analogies that could just as
easily be applied to API design. He provided some nice examples of how you can
avoid a whole class of potential error scenarios by just using a simpler
control in the first place. There were also examples of ideas that you would
expect to work, but didn’t, and cases where people used the tool in ways the
designers hadn’t anticipated. Some quotes from the likes of Donald Norman and
Alan Cooper provided a nice backdrop.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>That was the easy bit out of the way and a
shot of coffee was then needed whilst I spent the 30 minute break trying to
decide between 5 typically awesome sessions. Sometimes <span class=GramE>you</span>
just have to use darts, dice, a coin or whatever because the line-up is so
varied. For my first session I chose Peter Pilgrim’s Introduction to Scala. I
don’t generally follow the Java world but I have heard interesting things about
Scala and Peter’s introduction was a whirlwind tour of the various language
features. It has elements of functional languages that I’m not used to but his
examples still made sense and he finished off with a nice comparison of the
various JVM based languages that seem to be vying for the hearts and minds of
developers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The 90 minute lunch break is quickly over
when you’ve been nattering away and it was Lisa Crispin and her Dealing with
Defects talk that filled my early afternoon slot. This was an interesting look
at the techniques and tools that teams often use to track and manage bugs.
There was definitely a feeling that many organisations spend too much time on
tracking and managing bugs and not enough on preventing them in the first
place. Lisa got the audience to do a little exercise where we played the role
of developer and tester. The two had to collaborate to draw a simple map, first
standing back-to-back and then facing each other. This illustrated how much
better it is for the two to engage directly instead of via, say, email – simple
but very effective. This was a useful talk that helped to confirm my team are
heading in the right direction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I made Kevlin Henney’s talk about OO as my
final choice for the day because I saw his Value Objects session last year and
I clearly still have much to learn about OO even after all this time. He didn’t
disappoint this time either as he slowly managed to show that the SOLID
principles rest on flaky ground, ending up with just SID! However I got the
feeling that the Single Responsibility Principle (the S in SOLID) should also
be taken under advisement. His revelation about the Liskov Substitution
Principle was most enlightening and goes to show that the terms type, subtype,
class, interface, abstract data type, etc. are often banded about and
incorrectly used interchangeably in OO circles. The question now is whether I
still answer “Encapsulation, Polymorphism and Inheritance” in a job interview?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Sadly Uncle Bob couldn’t provide the
closing day’s keynote and so Michael Feathers stepped up to the plate instead.
This was a curious keynote that I felt never really went anywhere. He commented
on the productivity of Ruby and noted the verbosity of C++ but never appeared
to come to any conclusion. Was he suggesting the world would be a better place
if we all switched to Ruby? Did the fact that there were so many C &amp; C++
programmers in the audience cause him to refrain from saying what he really
wanted to? If nothing else it generated chatter in the bar after…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tom Preston-Werner, one of the big cheeses
at Github, opened business on the Thursday morning. On the one hand it’s nice
to see that some companies can provide an excellent place to work, but on the
other there is a large degree of smugness that goes with this kind of
presentation. Unmetered holidays, self organising teams, a bar on-site, and
they’re making a profit too - it sounds like programming nirvana. It sure will
be interesting to see how it scales with the age of the employees and the size
of the company.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>My first optional session for the day was
titled Distributed Computing 2.0 by Filip Van Laenen. I wasn’t sure what to
expect from this as I didn’t really read the blurb and therefore was somewhat
surprised to hear the details of his hobby project that used Twitter as the
communication channel for a distributed system. This immediately raised many
questions in my mind about scalability and reliability and he answered nearly
all of them during his talk as he explained how Facebook and Yahoo/Google
Groups could also be used in a channel bonding style. The problem he is
attempting to solve fits nicely inside the limits of the architecture; ok, so
it’s not a general purpose solution, but he never claimed it was. I soon
started thinking about how to use the add-on services like yfrog and twitpic to
overcome the message size limits so it’s clearly had some impact.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I suppose I didn’t really have a choice
about what I was going to see in the afternoon. Given that I had stayed up in
the bar into the wee hours Tuesday night to listen to an argument about
equality I just had to go and see Roger Orr and Steve Love cover the subject in
detail. This focused mainly on the pitfalls of how to correctly do an
equivalence comparison in Java and C# as there is much complexity involved. C#
has a plethora of interfaces for dealing with equality – more than I knew. They
also showed some really ‘interesting’ behaviour around the way one JVM caches
the boxed values -100 to +100. It’s not often that people remark how simple C++
is, but in this case it really is and the wording in the standard backed that
up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I felt I needed to hear some hard-core
techie stuff at some point and so Scott Meyers was the perfect choice with a
session all about CPU’s and cache lines. Scott is an entertaining presenter and
he made the low-level topic easily understandable. Although I was aware of many
of the symptoms and solutions from Herb Sutter’s writings I gained a much better
insight into the hardware side and why these problems exist. I have much more
respect for the chip designers now! He also briefly covered Profile Guided
Optimisation and Whole Program Optimisation to cover the instruction cache side
of things. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Lightning talks – 5 minute talks by the
general populace – made their appearance again this year and their popularity
is clearly growing as the number of speakers approached 23 over the two days. Olve
Maudal kicked off the first set of talks with a tongue-in-cheek piece called Technical
debt is good! Other notable shorts include Pete Goodliffe’s Manyfestos, which
was a poke at the ever growing number of developer manifestos out there, and Mark
Dalgano’s Optimise for Unhappiness which reflected back on the day’s keynote to
show how too many companies treat their employees.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Friday’s keynote was due to be given by <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>both</i> authors of the hugely popular book
Growing Object Orientated Software, but unfortunately it was left to Steve
Freeman to go it alone. The title, Good Enough Is the Enemy of Better, sums up
perfectly how software development is often approached in many organisations.
But Steve showed how it can be a false economy and that doing it right can pay
dividends both from an operational and maintenance perspective. As someone who
is currently working on a system built this way it’s great to be nodding in absolute
agreement instead of longing to be taking part.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The morning coffee break was swiftly
followed by a visit to see Jon Skeet discuss Java and C# - the lessons learned
and mistakes replicated by the latter from the former. Jon may be a Java
programmer by day and C# hobbyist by night, but he still knows way more about
C# than most! The discussion about the differences, such as the handling of
generics was typically enlightening as was the curious adoption of much of the
Object behaviour and how that was probably a bad choice. I left somewhat
disappointed as I had hoped for more crystal ball gazing and the answers to
some of his questions where clearly already in “C++” and “D” which just goes to
show how hard it is to keep up with even the “curly brace” languages.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The weather really brightened up for lunch
and it was somewhat of a shame to be stuck indoors in the afternoon, but if
anyone is ever a ray of sunshine it’s Tom Gilb. I thought I should go to at
least one “process” related talk and the contentious title “What’s Wrong <span
class=GramE>With</span> Requirements” sounded like it could generate some
debate. Tom’s premise always seems to be that everything can be measured and
quantified and this was no different. What seems to be wrong is that we use
“woolly” terms instead of backing them up with a measurable value to guide the design
and implementation. A simple message but fairly well rammed home with plenty of
entertaining anecdotes and tangents that only Tom seems to get away with.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I really had no option about what to go to
after the break because I was one of those going to be doing the talking! It
was a great experience that I felt went pretty well, even if I did speak a
little too quickly. Interestingly however feedback suggests that I need to do
work in other areas instead; such is the problem with not being able to watch
yourself. The good thing is that I have 12 months to work on my presentation skills
before next year.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The second round of lightening talks
followed the day’s final coffee break and once again it was a packed with
speakers. Didier Verna is clearly in the wrong job and should be “treading the
boards” as he appeared again – twice. Richard Harris rose to the challenge from
Roger Orr and Steve Love by showing us how to correctly compare floating point
numbers and Jim Hague tried to drum up interest for the local folk dancing
display before showing what he’d unearthed whilst spelunking the King James’ Bible.
Phil Nash closed the year’s talks with a very succinct demonstration of his new
lightweight unit testing framework called Catch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Friday always plays host to the Speakers’
Dinner where the attendees get to spend a little more time up close and
personal with the presenters. After each course they have to switch tables
whilst the speakers stay put so there is always someone new to chat with. There
was also an auction in aid of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Bletchley</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Park</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> that raised a few
thousand pounds and the announcement of the handing over of the conference
chair duties from Giovanni Asproni to Jon Jagger – a tough act to follow! The
formal proceedings finished around <st1:time Minute="0" Hour="23" w:st="on">11
 pm</st1:time> and so the bar played host to those that wished to continue the
festivities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Sadly my presence ended a little earlier
this year and so I had to miss out on the Saturday sessions. I haven’t even
looked at what was on because it will only depress me further knowing what has
escaped me. I know I say it each year, but you really cannot put a price on the
time you spend with the speakers and other attendees in the bar at the end of
each day. Yes, as the evening progresses the value-per-pint slowly diminishes,
but even at <st1:time Minute="0" Hour="4" w:st="on">4 am</st1:time> after going
round the houses a few times it’s good to know that even those you would
consider at the top of their game still have much to debate.</span></p>
