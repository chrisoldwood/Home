<p class=MsoTitle><span lang=EN-GB>In The Toolbox – Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus</span></p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>One of the reasons I reckon I got into
computer programming was to avoid having to write – not code, but actual
English prose. I hated it. At school, when I was 16, I had to take exams in
both English Language and English Literature and I did phenomenally bad – I got
a 'U' in both. For those unfamiliar with the English education system circa
1986 a 'U' means Unclassified. It means I did <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>so</i> badly that they can't even give me a grade – even an 'F', the
lowest grade, would be too good for me. Of course I had to take it again as a
'C' grade was mandatory to get anywhere, such as University, and I got it,
eventually.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Computer programming on the other hand was
great. Back in the '80s I was a bedroom coder bashing out nuggets of assembler
on various 8-bit micros. The best thing about assembler was that there weren't
many mnemonics to learn and they weren't spelled properly anyway (e.g. MOV,
SUB, JP, etc.) or they were acronyms (e.g. LEA – Load Effective Address). If
you did misspell anything the assembler would probably pick you up on it right
away as the code wouldn't compile (should that be &quot;assemble&quot;?).
Transposition-style errors were possible but it was more likely that you got
the logic wrong than the &quot;spelling&quot; of the code.</span></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-GB>The Writing's On the Wall</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Wind the clock forward another 10 years and
we're into the realms of Object-Oriented languages and silly limits like
8-character long identifiers have become a relic of the past. The idea of
Design Patterns has sprung up to give us a common vocabulary with which to
discuss recurring design problems. Also we're now talking about domain
modelling so that we can represent both abstract and concrete forms of business
concepts in our code as classes and functions to solve much bigger problems. The
world I was residing in at that moment in time was still in the territory of
&quot;office automation&quot;, but the problems we were solving were more
abstract as we tried to make sense of how the Internet was adding a technical
spin around historically mechanical processes. Suddenly I discover that <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>real</i> language is everywhere in my job.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The wake-up call for me that my weak
natural language skills were a genuine problem was seeing how others had
started to work around my limitations. In a number of cases one developer had
created typedef's (aliases, for non-C++ programmers) as a way of correcting the
spelling of some of my class names. Back then there was no decent IntelliSense
to guide you, and on a large codebase hitting the compiler only to find that
you'd not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>misspelled</i> a type correctly
cost you a non-trivial amount of time. And these classes were in the core
library. Another stand-out moment was around my confused use of the words
&quot;license&quot; and &quot;licence&quot; such that the noun and the verb
were misused badly enough to create configuration and code hell for those that
knew the difference.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>If that wasn't bad enough working with a
colleague who was using Whole Tomato's Visual Assist product, which not only
spell checks your comments and string literals, but also your class and method
names (including compound words!), was a real eye opener. What I selfishly
thought was me just being a bit quirky, perhaps even slightly endearing, was
fast becoming an embarrassment. Everywhere I looked now there were little red
squiggly lines under what I was writing – be it code <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>or</i> prose.</span></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-GB>Turning the Tables</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>In what could probably be viewed as a
poacher-turned-gamekeeper reversal of roles I now find myself on the other side
of that fence. And the situation is more unpleasant than I ever suspected. In
an even more ironic twist of fate I find myself writing more documentation now
that I'm &quot;doing agile&quot; than I ever did before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It was over 10 years before I even saw a
technical or functional spec and I only added a single paragraph to the one I
did come across. No, the way I focused my efforts (initially) on writing was to
put together lengthy diatribes about the state of the codebase and the lack of
good engineering practices being used, i.e. go all passive-aggressive. Whilst
this ended up having little-to-no impact on changing the attitudes within the team,
it did give me an outlet with which to practice writing proper prose. I coupled
this together with putting a developer (rather than support) focused wiki to
document some of the more common gotchas, such as how to merge integration
branches efficiently in ClearCase, or diff for all changes between two labels.
I also started to follow the advice of Record Your Rationale from the book 97
Things Every Software Architect Should Know [1]. My desire to write short, but
more importantly clear documentation was also largely prompted by working in a
multi-cultural team for the first time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Naturally when you start paying closer
attention to such matters in your own code you also begin to notice those
deficiencies in other people's output too. I've had to fix
&quot;eclipsing&quot; issues in ClearCase due to random capitalization, e.g.
Counterparty vs. CounterParty, missed diagnostic clues due to misspelled words
not matching log file greps, and hunting longer in source code repos when doing
some software archaeology [2] due to badly written commit messages. Having
non-native English speakers working on the codebase too was also an eye opener
as I struggled to explain why some of the code they wrote just didn't read
particularly well. Up to that point I hadn't realised it was even possible to
write &quot;grammatically incorrect&quot; code and I felt more than a little
churlish about bringing it up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>And so finally we come to two very old
fashioned &quot;tools&quot; that I've since grown to depend on...</span></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-GB>The Dictionary</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Once upon a time a dictionary was a
cutting-edge feature, even for a word processor or desktop publisher, and a stand-alone
dictionary application would cost serious money. These days they are often
built into FOSS tools like Notepad++, and the commit dialog for the TortoiseXxx
VCS extensions has one too so there is no excuse for misspelling a commit
message unless your language is unsupported. Chrome was the first browser I
used which had dictionary support for text boxes that made writing blobs of
text like blog post comments easier as you no longer had to paste the text into
Notepad++ or Word just run the spell checker over it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I mentioned earlier that spell checking
wasn't restricted to just prose either, it could also be performed on code. And
not just comments and string literals, but also on class, method and variable
names too by tools like Visual Assist. In the intervening years I've seen a few
free plug-ins to the popular IDE's that will handle comments and string
literals, but sadly they won't have a stab at identifiers which I think is a
shame. Perhaps too many developers still write code with overly terse names?
For code running on the .Net platform the FxCop tool is one of the few
exceptions, it also allows you to add your own domain-specific acronyms and
terms to a custom dictionary to minimise the false positives.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>As for spell checking files using a
command-line based tool there is Ispell, Aspell and more recently Hunspell.
Whilst these are suitable for checking prose, I'm only aware of Aspell as
having support for checking code (and even then only C/C++ comments and
literals).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>When it comes to checking the spelling of a
word on my smartphone, which has a reasonable but not extensive dictionary, I
end up reaching for Google. By default just searching for a single word will
suggest an alternative if spelled incorrectly and the first hit is usually the
definition, although you can Google &quot;define &lt;word&gt;&quot; to ensure
the first hit <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is</i> the definition.
However that always feels like the proverbial &quot;sledgehammer to crack a
nut&quot; but I'm too much of a cheapskate to cough up for a decent dictionary
app (assuming I can find room on the device for it but that's another story).</span></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-GB>The Thesaurus</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>My wife's English teacher once told her
never to use the words get, put or nice. In his opinion there are so many
better synonyms in the English language that a writer should never feel the
need to use them. From a software development perspective I can't say the word
&quot;nice&quot; has been much of a problem but the other two seem to crop up
with alarming regularity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>When it comes to naming properties of a
class (in programming languages where properties are not a first class concept)
you could be forgiven for thinking that the getValue/setValue pair is
mandatory. As a consequence of this there is also a school of thought that any
method which is prefixed with &quot;get&quot; is therefore a property and so
likely comes with a similar performance guarantee too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>In the online thesaurus I looked at there
were pages and pages of synonyms and related words for &quot;get&quot;. Off the
top of my head I can think of a number of really common alternatives that I use
regularly, such as: create, make, build, acquire, fetch, locate, find,
retrieve, request, derive and calculate. You can probably already see a few
patterns here as the initial ones revolve around the creation of objects, the
middle few with looking up things and the final couple for doing some form of
processing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Although there are no formal guidelines
about what semantics any of these words might suggest (despite at least one
attempt by yours truly [3]) I would hope that they provide at least a little
more insight than the weaker &quot;get&quot;. For example the words fetch,
request and retrieve all hint at some form of more complex operation than
simply returning the value of a member variable. Hopefully the level of
complexity hinted also suggests that failure is probably on the cards and so
may need to be factored in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Whilst code may not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>be</i> prose, little variation in the verbs used in method names makes
code read very monotonously. Test names that follow a classic given/when/then
format will often also end up being very mechanical in nature. You may have a
bit more leeway with test names, but that doesn't absolve you of being
economical with the language to succinctly convey the behaviour under test.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>These days a thesaurus is always within
easy reach if you have an internet connection and it only takes a few moments
to search and find something appropriate for the task in hand. However, sadly
they are far less accessible than a dictionary within text editors and
browsers. Hence I often have a copy of Word lying around in the background so
that I can switch to it, type the word I'm looking to replace and hit shift-F7
to get a bunch of alternatives within seconds. Being a native application it also
takes up far less resources than <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>another</i>
Chrome tab.</span></p>

<h1><span lang=EN-GB>Epilogue</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>My journey as a programmer took an
unexpected turn just over a decade ago as I finally found myself unable to
avoid the similarities between writing readable code and prose. Instead of
being a chore I have actually found the experience of &quot;raising my
game&quot; quite liberating. In fact where once I found the idea of learning
about natural languages quite unappealing, I now find the subject far more
attractive exactly because there are many parallels with programming. And
whilst I may not write code, tests or documentation to rival a bestselling
novel, I hope that the extra attention to detail adds precision and clarity
that ultimately benefits the reader.</span></p>
