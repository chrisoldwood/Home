<p class=MsoTitle>An Interview Icebreaker</p>

</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kicking off an interview can be hard. We all know what it’s
like to be on the other end of the phone line or the other side of the desk
waiting to be fed questions that might be designed to trip us up or check out
how much we know about the esoteric and dark corners of our technology stack.
Being in fear of this is not a good way to get a candidate to be comfortable
and therefore to stand a good chance of performing somewhat near how they would
on the job.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Telephone interviews are a common early screening technique
and in my experience it’s an all too common scenario where interviewers cut-to-the-chase
and launch into a series of gnarly questions which often do little to either
prepare you for the job in question, or they hope to filter you out as quickly
as possible so they can get back to their day job.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This kind of approach has always bugged me and so over the
last few years I have been trying to find better ways to ease potential
candidates into the interview process so that hopefully they’re more
comfortable and eager to chat about what makes them tick. One such icebreaker
that I’ve developed has turned out to be quite useful, not least because what
started out purely as a bit of fun has on occasion provided some interesting
insights that became useful with candidates later in the overall process.</p>

<h1>The Technique</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>The basic premise of the icebreaker is to present the
candidate with a number of somewhat silly and seemingly pointless comparisons
and ask them to (arbitrarily) choose one. Even in just a few minutes it’s quite
easy to rattle through a couple of dozen, which, if chosen reasonably well
should bring a smile to candidate’s face and maybe even a “knowing glance” or a
slightly quizzical “hmmm”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The outcome is largely intended to get the candidate talking
comfortably and therefore I usually take a fair bit of effort to convince them that
this is all just a bit of harmless fun, and that the answers are by-and-large
utterly meaningless. Some candidates are a little more suspicious than others
and so I always make sure I start with the more trivial questions to make sure
they quickly get the hang of it and realise I’m not going to suddenly ask them
to estimate the number of lampposts in Liverpool or the inner workings of a
modern garbage collector. (I also steer clear of the obvious choices such as
whitespace characters or text editors.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hence my opening few questions generally go like this:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
     normal'>Google or Bing?</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
     normal'>Android or iPhone?</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
     normal'>Laptop or desktop?</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
     normal'>Twitter or Facebook?</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
     normal'>Book or blog?</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
     normal'>Chrome or Firefox?</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Time or space?</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>As you can see there is clearly no right or wrong answer,
they are purely a matter of opinion (unless it involves Internet Explorer or
Visual SourceSafe). Some candidates might initially try to give you some
justification, e.g. why Bing is so much better these days, and therefore you
may have to remind them that it’s <i>really</i> just a bit of fun. Consequently
I have a number of very silly comparisons that I like to throw in if I feel something
even more light-hearted would help with the defrosting process, for example:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;
margin-left:35.7pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:-17.85pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class=MsoNormalCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:35.7pt;text-indent:-17.85pt;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class=MsoNormalCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:35.7pt;text-indent:-17.85pt;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Jira or Post-It notes?</p>

<p class=MsoNormalCxSpMiddle style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
0cm;margin-left:35.7pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:-17.85pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>BDD or TDD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt'>My original intention was to throw
some less random, but perhaps also still apparently arbitrary choices in just
to see what the reaction was. I was a little concerned that if I picked a
specific technology or process that was in use on the actual project then
candidates might feel obliged to answer with that choice or they might feel I’m
trying to catch them out in some way. Hence these were some of the slightly
less arbitrary choices that I initially began to mix in:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;
margin-left:35.7pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:-17.85pt;line-height:normal'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;
margin-left:35.7pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:-17.85pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Scrum or Kanban?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;
margin-left:35.7pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:-17.85pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;
margin-left:35.7pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:-17.85pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Mock or stub?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>SOAP or REST?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt'>While this was still mostly a bit
of fun I wanted to see if I could come up with some more coding specific
choices that I could weave in later on that might give a suitable candidate
something a little more meaty to chew on. I realised that this was potentially
moving away from my original goal but given the way candidates had been
responding to the exercise it felt like it was worth a punt. These were some of
the choices I began to add (mostly for C# senior developer roles):</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
     normal'>Interface or abstract base class?</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
     normal'>Tuple or struct?</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
     normal'>Unit test or acceptance test?</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
     normal'>Inheritance or composition?</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
     normal'>Zero element array or Enumerable.Empty?</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
     normal'>Null string reference or empty string value?</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
     normal'>ToArray() or ToList()?</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
     normal'>Test-before or test-after?</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
     normal'>Build script or build service?</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
     normal'>Feature branch or feature toggle?</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Lambda or closure?</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>These were all pretty well received although naturally some
candidates had to be reassured occasionally that the answer to every single
question was really “it depends”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I always liked to finish off with a couple of silly ones
just to make sure we ended the exercise on the right note. I would also check
their “temperature” by asking them if they enjoyed the exercise and whether
they felt “warmed-up” and ready for something a little more “deep”. (The rest
of the telephone interviews were longer questions aimed at exploring how they
solved particular kinds of problems, e.g. parallel data loads, cache
construction, monitoring, etc.)</p>

<h1>Retrospective</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>When I started out this was intended to just be an
icebreaker, I never for a moment believed that anyone’s preference for Bing
over Google, or watching tutorial videos instead of reading books was going to
be an indication of a programmer who would be unsuitable for a role. And I
still don’t. However, perhaps unsurprisingly, as the set of questions grew some
minor tell-tale signs did appear, which, by themselves, were not something
you’d make a hiring decision on but maybe did indicate areas that you might
want to focus on in the rest of the interview if there were no other pressing
concerns.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For example, terminology was one aspect that came up a few
times. While someone starting out their career in programming might not have
been introduced to terms like “tuples” (however you choose to pronounce it) or
“feature toggles” I am more surprised when a senior-level programmer is unaware
of them. And, while they should be able to pick up new concepts relatively
quickly, if it forms a significant part of the role then that is something I’d
like to double-check sooner rather than later. On the plus side having a
candidate admit up-front they don’t know something is a good sign which should
be appreciated. Hence, in response to this I started throwing in the “lambda or
closure?” near the end just to see what the response was.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some of the more subtle clues I managed to pick-up on were
around the combination of choices. In a number of cases the follow-up interview
was a programming exercise – just a simple kata. Solving the kata in the short interview
timeframe was never really the goal, but seeing how they approached it and
responded to questions about their approach, was. For example in one case a
candidate who had chosen “abstract base class” over “interface” and
“inheritance” over “composition” showed the hallmarks of a C# programmer still
thinking like a 90’s C++ programmer, in the sense that the design was classic
Gang of Four rather than more idiomatic C#. After that discovery I made a note
to try out biasing my follow-up questions slightly to explore class design in
preference to other topics. (This was not the only characteristic which made
that particular candidate unsuitable for that specific role but it did
highlight how important writing code can be in an interview process.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On a similar note I began to use a candidate’s preference
for ToList(), the object initializer syntax, etc. as a cue to discuss mutability
concerns. In the intervening years I’ve started to throw in a few other classic
trade-offs such as returns codes and exceptions, null references and options,
and primitive types versus domain types partly for variety but also to see what
reactions it provokes or smells it might give off.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since I started using this icebreaker a few years ago I’ve
never dismissed a candidate purely because I didn’t like the choices they made.
On the contrary I’m well aware that “one size never fits all” and diversity is
to be embraced and therefore it’s only been used as a line of conversation to
explore the forces that drive their choice and, more importantly, to see whether
they are conscious ones or not.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It’s almost certainly an unconventional technique, at least
by normal enterprise recruiting standards, and therefore it has the potential
to have the opposite effect and make some candidates more nervous, not less. Not
everyone is happy in an interview to just say the first thing that comes into
their head and so I have been careful to gauge their opening responses to see
if it’s working against me. Apart from one candidate that proceeded to launch
into a lengthy explanation on the very first question to justify their choice,
I’m not aware of anyone else that’s not got the hang of it pretty quickly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Feedback from candidates appears to be favourable, mostly
from the novelty angle. The fact that recruitment agents have mentioned it
seems to back that up. The reason I find that feedback pleasing is that we have
to remember interviews are a two-way street – the candidate is interviewing us
as much as we are interviewing them. Asking the same boilerplate questions does
little to help sell your position to them, whereas putting a little more effort
into the process might help compensate for a less stellar job spec. In my
experience working with interesting people rates pretty highly on the job
satisfaction scorecard and so I’ll try whatever tricks I can to try and lure
those candidates in. I wouldn’t want them to turn the job down prematurely
because the interview process was uninspiring.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Interviewing for a new job is always a daunting prospect,
especially when you’re a bit rusty. Acknowledging that and factoring it into
your interview process should help you make the most of those precious few
minutes you get with each candidate. This icebreaker is intended to inject a
little light-hearted humour into a traditionally stale process and, maybe, at
the same also provide a rapid-fire technique for triangulating on further points
of discussion. If nothing else you’ll have a bit of fun coming up with a list
of amusing choices.</p>
