Web Application Development in Java with <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">AJAX</st1:place></st1:City>
and <span class=SpellE>ORMs</span><o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>March 2010 saw the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">London</st1:place></st1:City> branch of the ACCU meet to listen to
Paul Grenyer talk about Enterprise Web Application Development. After a brief
biography and definition of what an Enterprise Application is he leapt into the
heart of the topic – writing code to communicate with a database. Unlike his
previous talks where he demonstrated code with slides, this time he decided to
go ‘live’ and use Eclipse, a shell and later a web browser as his presentation
tools. This is always a brave move but aside from one minor glitch it went very
smoothly and I think everyone appreciated seeing real code running against a
real database.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The first half of the presentation looked
at techniques for mapping objects to relational databases. His first example
was a classic manual SQL approach where the developer writes all the code to
invoke the query, extract the result data and clean up. Anyway who attended his
previous talk about resource management in database access code will know the
lengths required for this approach. He then switched to using one of the most
popular O/RM tools (Hibernate) to take much of the legwork out of this affair.
This was then refined over subsequent iterations to slowly reduce the amount of
client code at the expense of a more complex class hierarchy using the Data <span
class=SpellE>Mapper</span> and Registry patterns. The payoff though was the
ability to Unit Test and Integration Test your Database Access layer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The Integration Testing aspect was of
particular interest to me as I had been working on this issue myself, albeit in
C#, and was glad to see I was following a similar approach. Paul had <span
class=SpellE>MySQL</span> running locally and the technique involved creating a
database from scratch that contained just the tables and objects – no data. The
tests would then be responsible for adding and removing any data; he used the
natural rollback feature of transactions to perform the clean up. His test code
essentially performed a round-trip by writing a new object and then reading it
back again, being careful to ensure he was really hitting the database and not
being served up his previous object from some internal cache.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The latter part of his presentation looked
at the GUI side of things and the Google Web Toolkit (GWT) in particular. This
toolkit allows you to write your presentation code in Java as well - turning it
into JavaScript to run in the client’s browser – so that you can use the same
code on both client and server. The server-side logic was exposed as a web
service using JETTY and invoked from the client via <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">AJAX</st1:place></st1:City>. Having only done classic ASP in the
past I found it quite impressive to see what could be achieved with such little
code and the murmurs from the audience seemed to concur. His parting gift was
to skin the UI with a light dash of CSS to show it could easily be <span
class=SpellE>tarted</span> up without touching the code.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>As always we moved from the conference room
to the pub across the road to continue any discussions, although I probably
monopolised the speaker as I had a number of questions about his Integration
Testing methods. His talk may have had Java in the title, but as is often the
case many of the concepts and techniques he illustrated apply equally well to
other similar platforms such as C#/.Net. I look forward to watching the full
version at this years ACCU conference next month.</span></p>
