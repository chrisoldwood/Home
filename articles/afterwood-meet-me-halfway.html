<p class=MsoNormal>I’m only a few days back into work at the dawn of a new year
and I’ve already chalked up a couple of meetings. This particular one is the overrun
for the planning meeting we held yesterday, and it looks like we’ll need at
least one more to finish things off. My colleague made a nervous remark about
how long it’s taken to cover all the topics we had on the list, and so I made
light of the situation by pointing out that I’ve spent longer than this in sprint
planning meetings that are only looking at the next two weeks. In our case we’re
trying to look ahead at the next 12 months, so I’m hardly surprised we have
plenty to discuss, not least because most of the people are new to the team so
there’s a plethora of history and context to fill in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After spending the last three years filling the void between
Development and Operations acting more like a service desk, I’m quite pleased
to slow the pace down and have the opportunity to sink my teeth into something meatier.
Not long before Christmas my diary only contained two meetings a week, and one of
them was only held on alternate weeks which probably sounds like nirvana to
some. The change in teams has brought with it a couple of extra regular entries
in the diary for catch-ups but hardly anything arduous. Some kind of “daily
stand-up” has been a part of my professional routine for so many years now it felt
really odd when it wasn’t there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The employees at Shopify started the new year with what many
see as a belated Christmas present – all regular meetings of more than two
people were cancelled, along with a cooling off period before they can be re-added.
The premise, according to their CEO, is that many meetings “are a bug” and the
underlying cause should be fixed instead. In his tweet he cited trust, clarity,
and missing APIs as common “root” causes. The article I read suggested they
were also cancelling <i>all</i> meetings on a Wednesday (but didn’t say if that
was to allow more time for sports activities like at school), while Thursday was
reserved for any large meetings. In essence they want to put more time back in
the hands of people to get on with actually building stuff.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When it comes to hot takes about meetings my personal
favourite is this tweet from some years ago:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>“Meetings are complete
distraction from coding. Without them, I could work without interruption on
solving the wrong problems.” -- @raganwald</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To be sure, it was a flippant remark, but there’s more than
a grain of truth in there. I’ve been witness to at least two occasions where someone
has gone off on a tangent for a couple of weeks and churned out a large body of
code that was either far in excess of what was needed to solve the problem, or created
more problems than we already had. Unlike a suggestion in a meeting which can often
be reasoned about and either improved upon or dismissed in a fast timeframe, reverting
a whole ton of somebody’s code after they’ve sweated over it for hours is a
much tougher prospect as their loss is likely to be so much greater. In both
cases I had the unenviable job of breaking the bad news to them that we needed
to revert their efforts as there was considerably more technical debt than
credit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In some way I’m not surprised this happens. Back in the late
noughties Daniel Pink famously ascribed autonomy, mastery, and purpose towards
what drives people to be motivated. The aspect of autonomy can lead us to take
on far more than we are equipped to handle by ourselves. Like free-speech, it
doesn’t mean you get to do what you want without consequences – you still need
to be accountable for your actions. The intent was to avoid micro-managing people,
but not at the cost of removing collaboration altogether. Instead, autonomy puts
the power to collaborate back in the hands of the producer so they have more
control over when and where it happens. However, if you’re going to adopt a
more “trust, but verify” approach you don’t want to leave it too long before
doing some “verifying”, lest the waste starts to accumulate and course corrections
become ever more costly. Ideally you want a balance between giving out creative
freedom whilst also ensuring they have access to the kinds of people they will <i>want</i>
to draw upon because they provide insights in a positive manner. The best kind
of people often go out of their way to have their work and opinions challenged as
they treat failure as an opportunity for learning. (Egoless Programming was first
coined by Gerry Weinberg way back in the early 1970s in <i>The Psychology of
Computer Programming</i>.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My take on the drastic actions by Shopify is not to stifle collaboration,
as that <i>has</i> to happen somewhere, but to try and eliminate some waste by avoiding
unproductive meetings or removing unnecessary people from the equation. For me,
an unproductive meeting though is often a smell that there is some confusion that
needs resolving, which I guess is what the CEO of Shopify is getting at, but I’d
rather do that quickly face-to-face than have to experience the tortuous route
of a protracted email exchange or pull request with a number of comments to rival
War &amp; Peace. If you’re in Rumsfeld territory facing unknown unknowns you’ll
want to navigate out of there as quickly as possible to at least the safer
harbour of known unknowns.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I remember a project manager getting tetchy once because we
went around in circles in a few design meetings apparently arguing about a particular
concept. He saw it as disruptive, but I saw the conflict as a sign that we were
missing something fundamental, and we were, we just didn’t discover what it was
until an iteration or two later. When it did finally emerge all the confusion made
sense, along with the realisation that we needed a much broader view of the business
than many of our existing users had had up to that point.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I write we’re just about to pass the third anniversary of
the first Covid lockdown in the UK, along with the sudden switch to long-term remote
working for many businesses. The consequential rise in asynchronous communication
via the written word and video recordings will have been liberating for some employees
more used to a classic 9 to 5 schedule, rebalancing the work-life scales for them
in the process. But meetings can, and should have a social element too, even if
just for a minute or two here and there, and so I hope we don’t throw the
proverbial baby out with the bathwater in the stampede to deprecate
face-to-face contact.</p>
