</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>Starting work on a mature codebase is always an interesting
prospect. In some ways it’s like moving into a fully furnished home. As you
wander around your new abode you’ll wince at the choice of wallpaper, soft
furnishings, carpets and cabinets. As time passes those more superficial
distractions will fade away and be replaced by the more niggly issues which actually
affect your day-to-day life like the temperamental door lock, the broken light
over the sink, and the low ceiling in the cellar. While it’s somewhat
disingenuous to liken all mature codebases to the derelict house renovated by Mary
Bailey (Donna Reed) in <i>It’s a Wonderful Life</i>, the scenes of frustration
where George Bailey (James Stewart) accidentally pulls the finial off the top
of the newel post every time he goes upstairs has a familiar ring to it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is all too easy when we come across some code we don’t
like to be highly dismissive and even vocalise our displeasure. I don’t know
about builders, plumbers and electricians in other countries but here in the UK
they are renowned for looking at somebody else’s handiwork, shaking their head
and then telling you <i>they</i> wouldn’t have done it like that. I guess that somehow
that’s meant to make you feel more confident in their abilities because they
can spot bad workmanship in others and by logical deduction theirs must be better?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The late, great Jerry Weinberg has some advice that’s worth
bearing in mind when approaching a codebase that’s been around the block: “everything
got the way it is one logical step at a time”. The evolution of the system
happened under many constraints that we will not be aware of and it behoves us
to be respectful of the choices that were made even if we don’t personally
agree with them. Similarly “The Prime Directive” which is commonly read out
before a retrospective reminds us that we consider that people make choices
which are a product of the environment they work in rather than through any
personal weaknesses – the environment should not set you up to fail.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It’s easy for us when attempting to reshape a system towards
new ends to become frustrated with the code as it stands and to lash out at the
misgivings of our predecessors, even if that person is us. This negativity, which
perhaps feels justified, does little to help the situation and if left
unchecked begins to affect those around us. That famous poster from the Second
World War tells us “careless talk costs lives” and badmouthing other people’s
work when those involved may easily be in earshot or in the social network of
those around us does little to make them feel any better about the choices they
may have had to take. It always starts very innocently, often just a bit of
“banter”, but slowly that negativity can become the norm. Sarcasm is a
dangerous tool to wield in an open plan office where information disseminates by
osmosis pieced together from fragments of other conversations within earshot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But it’s our house, right? Surely that gives us permission
to shape it as we see fit? Yes, but only insofar as we shape what’s necessary
to allow us to overcome any hurdles placed in our way as a consequence of
earlier choices. You do not <i>automatically</i> gain permission to simply
remove the woodchip wallpaper because your personal preference is for painted
walls. Aside from the waste of time and money it is disrespectful and does
little to engender respect for yourself and your choices as your successors
reflect on your actions in the future. Collaboration is not simply about
communication with those present in the here-and-now but also with those who
went before us and will be there to take over once we have moved on. Entropy
always wins and therefore we need to be aware that those who come after us will
likely be dealing with more complexity than we ever had to so let’s not make it
any harder by throwing unrelated noise into the mix when it’s not an impediment
to our current progress.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When a spot of refactoring is beneficial it can be a
struggle to remain focused when we see paint starting to peel off the walls, the
tap in the bathroom dripping and know the kitchen door needs a few drops of oil
to stop it squeaking. None of these imperfections significantly hinder our
day-to-day living but are just symptoms of age, and codebases accrete similar
blemishes over time as the people, tools, and practices change – unsightly does
not imply a liability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lucius Cary (2<sup>nd</sup> Viscount Falkland according to
Wikipedia) once said “where it is not necessary to change, it is necessary not
to change.” Taken too literally you might not even bother to consider the
practice of refactoring or cleaning up code at all, let alone use it as a guide
to reign in any overzealous changes that appear to involve tidying up every
piece of unrelated code you passed through when debugging. The problem is that
change is occurring all around us and therefore it may become necessary to
change, despite not changing ourselves. While software doesn’t rot in the
physical sense it could be said to deteriorate when inconsistencies in the
idioms, layout, domain language, design, etc. begin to affect comprehension, at
which point that may well become an impediment. Sometimes change is so slow
that it is imperceptible at first, like an unused house decaying. Then, as the
Broken Windows theory posits, a tipping point is reached where upon that
dwelling rapidly deteriorates into the dilapidated form where Mary and George
Bailey spend their honeymoon and eventually set up home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both refactoring and the (Boy) Scout Rule can, and often
are, held up as a cause under which it’s okay to make sweeping changes in a
codebase because they are “best practice” and it makes the code “better”. Like
many programmers I have my own personal crusades such as the banishment of
“get” in favour of more expressive verbs such as make, format or derive, and
wider acceptance of domain types instead of an obsession with primitives. But
they are just that – personal preferences – it is entirely possible to write a
correctly functioning system without them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Making changes in sympathy with how a system has already
evolved, and will continue to evolve is hard. The temptation to “fix”
everything is very real but first we need to get straight in our heads what is
actually broken or untenable and what is simply unappealing.</p>
