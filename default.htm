<a name="Introduction"></a>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Welcome to my tiny corner of the Web. This site basically contains all the
Freeware software I have developed in the passed 10 or so years. Some of it
has only been released on CiX, others bits uploaded to some FTP servers and
the rest hasn't really seen the light of day - probably because I never got
it to a releasable state!
<br>
As you will see most of the site is still under construction, but hopefully
I will get it finished soon...
</p>

<a name="BinariesSources"></a>
<h3>Binaries &amp; Sources</h3>
<p>
Sources are available for everything. Binaries will be limited to those
applications where I know people won't want to, or can't build it
themselves. The sources are by no means an example of how to write good
code. My style has changed somewhat over the years and I'm not necessarily
sure it is for the better. At the end of the day you get what you pay for.
</p>

<a name="Licence"></a>
<h3>Licence</h3>
<p>
None of the code here is tied to any particular sort of licence. If you do
find something of interest either by using one of the apps or using some of
the source in one of your own apps, I would be grateful if you could drop
me a line to let me know.
</p>

<a name="Warranty"></a>
<h3>Warranty</h3>
<p>
I hope you're not looking for one, because it doesn't exist. All the code on
this site is supplied without any guarantees whatsoever. If I've done a
decent job you shouldn't experience any problems, however, given that I haven't
even finished some of the code on this site - you never can tell.
</p>

<a name="Feedback"></a>
<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>
I am happy to receive any feedback you have, whether it be bug reports, bug
fixes, suggestions for new features etc. The only type of feedback I'd rather
not get is flames...constructive criticism is always welcome, flames about
the style of { } placement will go straight in the bin.
