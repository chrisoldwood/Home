<a name="Introduction"></a>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Welcome to my tiny corner of the Web. This site contains all the Freeware
software I have developed over the past 15 or so years. Some of it was only
released on <a href="http://www.cix.co.uk/">CIX</a>, others bits were uploaded
to FTP servers like <a href="http://www.simtel.net/">SIMTEL</a>, and the rest
hasn't seen the light of day, because I never got it to a releasable state!
</p><p>
Most of the stuff here is ancient and probably of no interest to you, but you
never know what people find useful, hence the reason why I have included some
trivial DOS programs and even my unfinished projects. It is my attempt to give
something back to the development community.

<a name="Windows"></a>
<h3>Windows Compatibility</h3>
<p>
Most of the 32-bit applications were developed and tested under Windows 9x
and 2000 and the underlying framework started out on Windows 3.x. My aim
has always been to try and keep as much compatibility with the various 32-bit
OS's as possible. Nearly all the applications use the older technique of
storing their settings and data in files in the application folder, a model
which does not work well with Windows XP (Vista has a workaround). Consequently
if you are not running as an Administrator (and you should try not to) you will
need to install it to a folder other than "Program Files". I will be correcting
the applications over time to detect the Windows version and behave accordingly.
</p>

<a name="Binaries"></a>
<h3>Binaries</h3>
<p>
Binaries are available for virtually everything and the more recent releases
come with a simple setup program I wrote. The native applications are all
linked statically and use my own framework so there are no additional
dependencies like the VB, MFC or .NET runtimes. The only occasional dependency
is on the common controls DLL (COMCTL32.DLL) of which you need at least v4.71
which shipped with IE 4.
</p><p>
All the Win32 applications are available as both a <i>Release</i> build and a
<i>Debug</i> build. You should always follow the <b><i>Binary</i></b> link and
download the release build, the debug build is only of use if you experience a
problem and you want to help me fix it.
</p><p>
The Java applets are all JDK 1.1 based and should run on any JVM.
</p>

<a name="Sources"></a>
<h3>Source Code</h3>
<p>
The source code is available for everything, so if you want to tinker or fix
a bug then you can. Alternatively if you want to use some of the classes in
your own code, then you can do that as well, but you should be aware that I do
not consider this production level code. The C++ framework classes are my own
and have a long heritage which predates templates (as far as Visual C++ support
goes), so you will find non-STL style containers and other re-inventions of the
wheel rather than use of say the Boost libraries. This is because of a number of
reasons - compiler support, licensing issues, paradigm shifts and the simple fact
that a good way to learn is to <i>do-it-yourself</i>. That said, I intend to
refactor as much as possible with STL equivalents as and when I can.
</p><p>
The archives include projects and workspaces for Visual C++ 7.1 only. However
the code is targeted for Win95 and upwards and should still compile on
Visual C++ 6.x. The Java stuff comes with a Visual J++ workspace.
</p>

<a name="Licence"></a>
<h3>Licence</h3>
<p>
None of the code here is tied to any particular sort of licence. If you do
find something of interest either by using one of the apps or using some of
the source in one of your own apps, I would be grateful if you could drop
me a line to let me know. Also, please let me know if you upload something to
another site as I can then notify them of new releases.
</p>

<a name="Warranty"></a>
<h3>Warranty</h3>
<p>
I hope you're not looking for one, because it doesn't exist. All the code on
this site is supplied without any guarantees whatsoever. If I've done a
decent job you shouldn't experience any problems, but I have to cover my back
and warn you that only get what you pay for :-)
</p>

<a name="Credits"></a>
<h3>Credits</h3>
<p>
Most of this software could not have been written without the time and resources
of others, and so here is a big thank you to the people who have contributed to
my efforts...
<br><br>
<b><i>Ian Masters</i></b> and <b><i>Steve Sorrell</i></b> with whom I developed
the various NetWare utilities.
<br><br>
<b><i>Mark Woolcott</i></b> for a lot of technical assistance whilst writing the
NetDDE Bridge and being my main beta tester on UT Cache Manager.
<br><br>
<b><i>Graham Corless</i></b> for his feedback and ideas for F.C. Manager.
<br><br>
<b><i>Rusty Biggs</i></b> for testing the localisation fixes to Task Tracker.
</p>

<a name="Feedback"></a>
<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>
I am happy to receive any feedback you have, whether it be bug reports, bug
fixes or suggestions for new features. My public email account is pretty
overloaded with spam these days, so apologies up front if I don't reply - it
probably means your email got filtered out, not that I'm ignoring you...
<br><br>
