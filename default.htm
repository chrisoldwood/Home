Welcome to my tiny corner of the Web. This site contains all the Freeware
software I have developed over the past 25 or so years. Most of the apps are
for 32-bit Windows and would probably only be of interest to Windows developers,
however there are also a few apps for more general consumption.
<p></p>
Some of the stuff here, such as that for 16-bit Windows and DOS, is ancient and
probably of no interest to anyone, but you never know what people find useful,
hence the reason why I have included some trivial DOS programs and even my
unfinished projects. It is my attempt to give something back to the development
community, even if that "something" is how <i>not</i> to do it nowadays.

Most of the 32-bit applications were developed and tested under Windows 9x, 2000
and XP and the underlying framework started out on Windows 3.x. My aim
has always been to try and keep as much compatibility with the various 32-bit
OS's as possible.
<p></p>
Nearly all the applications use the older technique of
storing their settings and data in files in the application folder, a model
which does not work well with Windows XP and the Program Files folder (Vista and
later has a workaround). Consequently if you are not running as an Administrator
(and you should try not to) you will need to install it to a folder other than
Program Files. I will be correcting the applications when I can to use the
<code>%APPDATA%</code> folder instead for data, and allow the choice of
Registry or <code>.ini</code> files for program settings.

Binaries are available for virtually everything with the more recent releases
packaged as an MSI installer. I'm also returning to providing a classic .zip file
once again for those who prefer manual installations. Prior to the use of MSIs
you will just find the binaries packaged in a .zip file with possibly my own
simple, custom installer.
<p></p>
The native applications are all
linked statically and use my own framework so there are no additional
dependencies like the VB, MFC or .NET runtimes. The only dependency is on the
common controls DLL (<code>COMCTL32.DLL</code>) of which you need at least v4.71
which shipped with IE 4.
<p></p>
All the Win32 applications are available as both a <i>Release</i> build and a
<i>Debug</i> build. You should always follow the <b><u>Download</u></b> (or ZIP)
link and install the Release build; the Debug build is only of use if you
experience a problem and you'd like to help me try and fix it.
<p></p>
The Java applets are all JDK 1.1 based and should run on any JVM.

<tr><td class="content_body" colspan="2">
The source code is available for everything I've written, so if you want to
tinker or fix a bug then you can. Alternatively, if you want to use some of this
code in your own then feel free to do so, but you should be aware that I do not
consider this Production Grade code.
<p></p>
The C++ framework is my own creation and has a long heritage which pre-dates
templates (as far as Visual C++ support goes). Hence you will find non-STL style
containers in the older code and other reinventions of the wheel rather than
use of, say, the Boost libraries. This is because of a number of reasons -
compiler support, licensing issues, paradigm shifts and the simple fact that a
good way to learn is to <i>do-it-yourself</i>. That said, I intend to refactor
as much as possible with STL equivalents as and when I can.
<p></p>
<b>Project/Solution Format</b>
<p></p>
From February 2008 all C++ source archives come as Visual C++ 7.1 (VS2003) projects
and solutions with Unicode set as the default build type. The code should however 
still build as ANSI and is checked with Visual C++ 8.0 (VS2005), 9.0 (VS2008) and
10.0 (VS2010) - albeit the Express editions. I also alternate between STLport 5.x and
the native VC++ STL to try and maintain STL compatibility.
<p></p>
The non-COM libraries and some non-COM applications are also built as ANSI with
<a href="http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/">GCC 4.x</a> (via the <a href="http://www.codeblocks.org">Code::Blocks</a>
IDE). You will find a Code::Blocks <code>.workspace</code> file and various <code>.cbp</code>
files alongside the Visual C++ <code>.sln</code> and <code>.vcproj</code>
equivalents. The Code::Blocks files are not always perfectly in sync though. 
<p></p>
Prior to February 2008 you will find Visual C++ 7.1 solutions back to about
August 2004 and before that the Win32 solutions are Visual C++ 6.0 based. The
Java solutions come with a Visual J++ workspace, the Win16 code comes with a
Visual C++ 1.52c solution and the DOS tools come with an NMAKE makefile.
<p></p>
<b>Latest Code vs. Stable Snapshot</b>
<p></p>
The latest version of the source code for any projects I actively maintain can
be found on GitHub here: <a href="https://github.com/chrisoldwood">https://github.com/chrisoldwood</a>.
Most projects contain a file in the root called <code>DevNotes.txt</code> that
provides details on the source folder structure, dependent git library repos to
clone, build scripts, etc.
<p></p>
If you're looking for the last <i>stable</i> source code for any application you will
find a snapshot of everything you need (app + libs + tests + scripts) in the
application's "Source" .zip file on this web site. Whilst there are tags in the
GitHub <i>application</i> repos, there is no equivalent tag in the dependent
library repos and so you'd have to find the nearest relevant commit by date to
find the matching library code.

While I'd like to think that
<a href="http://www.wheatonslaw.com">Wheaton's Law</a> should be
enough of a "legal framework" under which users of my code should abide I realise
that it's just not formal enough for everyone to be confident about where they
stand. Consequently if you're looking for something more formal then you should
consider everything I publish as being covered by the more common
<a href="LICENSE.txt">MIT License</a>.
<p></p>
Of course if you do find something of interest, either by using one of the apps or some of
the source code in your own projects I would be grateful if you could drop me
a line. It's always nice to hear that I've done something of use to others, no
matter how small. Also, if you upload a binary or code to another site please
let me know as I can then notify you and them of new releases.
