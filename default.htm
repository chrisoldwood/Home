<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Welcome to my tiny corner of the Web. This site basically contains all the
Freeware software I have developed in the passed 10 or so years. Some of it
has only been released on CiX, others bits uploaded to some FTP servers and
the rest hasn't really seen the light of day - probably because I never got
it to a releasable state.
</p>

<a name="BinariesSources"></a>
<h3>Binaries &amp; Sources</h3>
<p>
Sources are available for everything. Binaries will be limited to those
applications where I know people won't want to, or can't build it
themselves. Increasingly I am also providing debug builds to help diagnose
problems on other set-ups. The code is all linked statically and doesn't use
the MFC so no DLL version conflicts should arise. The only real dependency
is on the common controls DLL (COMCTL32.DLL) - you need at least v4.71 which
shipped with IE 4.
<p>
The sources are by no means an example of how to write good code. Some of the
core libraries like WCL have a long heritage which predates templates and so
uses its own containers and string class. My style has also changed somewhat
over the years and I'm not necessarily sure it is for the better. At the end
of the day you get what you pay for.
<br>
The archives include projects and workspaces for Visual C++ 6. The last time
I checked, all the code compiled under Visual C++ 7.x as well.
</p>

<a name="Licence"></a>
<h3>Licence</h3>
<p>
None of the code here is tied to any particular sort of licence. If you do
find something of interest either by using one of the apps or using some of
the source in one of your own apps, I would be grateful if you could drop
me a line to let me know.
</p>

<a name="Warranty"></a>
<h3>Warranty</h3>
<p>
I hope you're not looking for one, because it doesn't exist. All the code on
this site is supplied without any guarantees whatsoever. If I've done a
decent job you shouldn't experience any problems, however, given that I haven't
even finished some of the code on this site - you never can tell.
</p>

<a name="Credits"></a>
<h3>Credits</h3>
<p>
Most of this software could not have been written without the time and resources
of others, and so here is a big thank you to the companies and people who have
contributed to my efforts...
</p><p>
<u>GST Software Plc</u> - My first employer. Most of the 16-bit DOS &amp; Windows
code was written whilst working here. Special thanks goes to <i>Ian Masters</i>
and <i>Steve Sorrell</i> for help developing the various NetWare utilities.
</p><p>
<u>Trio Internet Systems</u> - My current employer. Most of the 32-bit Windows
and Java code has been written within the last 5 years. A debt of gratitude goes
to <i>Mark Woolcott</i> for all his help, particularly whilst writing the NetDDE
Bridge and UT Cache Manager. Also thanks goes to <i>Graham Corless</i> for his
ideas for F.C. Manager.
</p>

<a name="Feedback"></a>
<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>
I am happy to receive any feedback you have, whether it be bug reports, bug
fixes, suggestions for new features etc. The only type of feedback I'd rather
not get is flames...constructive criticism is always welcome, flames about
the style of { } placement will go straight in the bin.
