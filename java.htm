<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
I have only been doing Java on and off for a year mostly on a project at work.
These applets and the framework are the results of my initial toyings with the
language. They are all based around the 1.1 JDK.
<br>
I warn you now, I have grown up with Microsoft Windows as a developer and as
such both use and like Hungarian notation (my version of it that is), if you
are easily offended by the sight of things like the <i>m_</i> prefix, don't
look at the source code. Also don't expect any JavaDoc type comments, because you
will be sorely disappointed - I'm sorry but I can't stand it.
</p>

<td><h3>Framework - Java Class Packages</h3></td>
<td align="right" valign="top">18/07/2001</td>

<td colspan="2">
<p>
These packages contain all the classes that are common to all my Java applets.
Currently it only contains UI classes for creating message boxes and modal
dialogs. The message box is styled to look like a standard Windows one.
<br>
There are a couple of stupid panel classes that I threw together to help me with
the layouts in the JLogo applet, I hope to replace these when I write a proper
layout manager.

<td colspan="2">
<p>
This applet is a visual tool for writing "Logo" programs - at least that is what
I wanted it to do. However, when I came to write it I realised that the only thing
I could remember is the idea of a turtle and some basic drawing commands.
Consequently JLogo is actually an approximation of a "Logo" IDE. The applet
provides you with a turtle, and a set of drawing commands. It also provides a
simple <i>loop</i> command and support for variables (of type <i>double</i>).
To get around the lack of access to the file system, the program can be stored
and loaded by cut and pasting from/to the source editor window.

<td align="right" valign="top">23/02/2001</td>

<tr>
<td colspan="2">
<p>
This applet basically loads an image file and converts the image pixels into a
series of <i>int</i> values that can be pasted into a static int array defined 
in a class. For an example look at the MsgBoxIcons.java class in the framework.
<br>
This applet came about because I wanted to remove the dependence of the MsgBox
class on a .gif file which held the icons - I wanted to embed the image data into
a byte array so that I could rely on the icons always being available.
<br>
It still needs alot of tarting up and runs too slowly because I populate the
output window on the fly. I'll fix these problems soon.
