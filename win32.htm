<td colspan="2">
<p>
This is the core library that all my applications rely on to provide the basic
C++ classes to wrap the WIN32 API. It is my equivalent of the MFC library. 
The library provides a basic set of application classes for dialog and SDI based
apps - wrappers for most of the common controls and GDI objects - a basic set of
container classes and some I/O classes.
<br>
It started as a WIN32 version of the same WCL that exists in my Win16 section, but
with support for the extra WIN32 features such as the new Common Controls.
However as I started reading about patterns and templates etc. I started to
rework some of the core application classes and templatize the old "generic"
container classes.
<br>
It is not a complete class library, it grows when requirements from my
applications forces it to, which isn't alot these days. Mostly I find that I
haven't provided a virtual function for a particular windows message, or that
I haven't supplied a wrapper function for a particular common control message.

<tr>
<td colspan="2">
<p>
This library provides classes to create an in-memory copy of a database. The data
and table schema can be provided programatically or derived from a query result
set run on an actual database. Currently ODBC is the only DB library supported with
ADO due soon. The database can also be serialized into a binary file. The library
supports many data types and natural database features such as indexing, primary
keys, foriegn keys and triggers. It was designed with performance more in mind than
features because I saw it most useful as a caching technology.

<p>
This is an updated version of the TASKTRAK application in the Win16 section.
The application is very simple, you clock in and out during the day and associate
a short phrase with each block of work. At any time you can run a report which
shows your hours grouped by week, month or task and sums them up based on the
grouping. The report can be viewed, printed or saved to a file or the clipboard.

<td><h3>PQT - Parameterized DB Query Tool</h3></td>
<td align="right" valign="top">05/06/2001</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2">
<p>
This tool is designed provide an alterative way to run parameterized queries
without having to resort to writing stored procedures. You write your basic
query and when it is correct you replace the hardcoded values with variable
names. Next time when you run the query it will prompt you for the variables
values in a dialog and substutue them in the query. It also allows you to
configure logical connections and associate script paths with them to make it
quicker to find and run scripts for a given database.
<br>
At the moment most of the tool is complete, you can set up logical connections,
load, save and execute queries and view the results. Unfortunately the only thing
you can't do is parameterize them as I haven't got around to that bit yet! I'm
afraid I started working with Java and haven't been back to finish this off.
