<p>
This is a utility for Unreal Tournament which allows you to manage the cache where
files are downloaded when you play online. It can move/copy files into your main
folders so that you can play the maps offline, copy files from another users cache
to save downloading over slow connections, remove failed downloads and old entries
from the cache index and restore files back to the cache if a conflict occurs.

<p>
This is an updated version of the TASKTRAK application in the Win16 section.
The application is very simple, you clock in and out during the day and associate
a short phrase with each block of work. At any time you can run a report which
shows your hours grouped by week, month or task and sums them up based on the
grouping. The report can be viewed, printed or saved to a file or the clipboard.

<td colspan="2">
<p>
This tool is designed provide an alterative way to run parameterised queries
without having to resort to writing stored procedures. You write your basic
query and when it is correct you replace the hard-coded values with variable
names. Next time when you run the query it will prompt you for the variables
values in a dialog and substitute them in the query. It also allows you to
configure logical connections and associate script paths with them to make it
quicker to find and run scripts for a given database.
<br>
At the moment most of the tool is complete, you can set up logical connections,
load, save and execute queries and view the results. Unfortunately the only thing
you can't do is parameterise them as I haven't got around to that bit yet!

This is an application for Football Club Secretaries to help them manage their
sides. It helps you keep track of club members, fixtures and monetary details
such as accounts and player debts. You can also use it to hold the details of
other club secrataries and referees in the league.
<br>
This is very much a "work-in-progress". A large majority of the functionality
is in place, but there is also still a lot to be done, particulary in the areas
of printing, team sheets and account management. If you do take and look and
think it might be useful, please let me know as it might spur me on to finish it!

<td colspan="2">
<p>
This is the core library that all my applications rely on to provide the basic
C++ classes to wrap the WIN32 API. It is my equivalent of the MFC library.
The library provides a basic set of application classes for dialog and SDI based
apps - wrappers for most of the common controls and GDI objects - a basic set of
container classes and some I/O classes.
<br>
It is a WIN32 version of the same WCL that exists in my Win16 section, but
with support for the extra WIN32 features such as the new Common Controls.
It is not a complete class library, it grows when requirements from my
applications forces it to, which isn't much these days.

<td colspan="2">
<p>
This library provides classes to create an in-memory copy of a database. The data
and table schema can be provided programmatically or derived from a query result
set run on an actual database. Currently ODBC is the only DB library supported with
ADO on the list. The database can also be serialized into a binary file. The library
supports many data types and natural database features such as indexing, primary
keys, foreign keys and triggers. It was designed with performance more in mind than
features because I saw it most useful as a caching technology.
